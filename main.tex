\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Our objective is to determine an enumerate formula which counts the
number of times a general cubic surface occurs in a general
$4$-parameter family $ \pi: X \to B$ of cubic surfaces.  We work
throughout with finite-type schemes over an algebraically closed,
characteristic ground field $k$.

\begin{definition}
  Let $\pi :X \to B$ be a flat, projective morphism of relative
  dimension $2$, with $B$ a $4$-dimensional proper scheme. We say
  $\pi$ is {\bf a good family of cubic surfaces} if for all $b \in B$,
  the fiber $X_{b}$ is isomorphic to a cubic surface which is not
  contained in a general cubic surface's $PGL_4$-orbit closure.
\end{definition}

The base of a good family carries the natural rank $4$
vector bundle
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:V}
  V := \pi_{*}\omega_{X/B}^{-1}.
\end{align}
The base $B$ of a good family of cubic surface admits a rational map
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:mu}
  \mu: B \dashrightarrow M
\end{align}
to the coarse moduli variety $M$ of cubic surfaces.  By general
equivariant-geometric arguments, there exists a universal
weighted-degree $4$ polynomial
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:P}
  P(v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4) = a_{1^4}v_{1}^{4} + a_{1^{2}2}v_{1}^{2}v_{2} + a_{13}v_{1}v_{3} + a_{2^2}v_{2}^{2} + a_{4}v_{4}
\end{align}
in the Chern classes $v_{i} = c_{i}V$, such that
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:equality}
  \deg P(v_{1},v_{2},v_{3},v_{4}) = \deg \nu
  \end{align}
Our goal is to determine $P$, which amounts to determining
the five coefficients $a_{\bullet}$.

This is essentially an exercise in the method of indetermined
coefficients. We devote each section to the construction of a
particular good family.  After each section, we reset notation.

\section{Family $B_1$}
\label{sec:first-test-family}

In this section, we let $S_7 \subset \P^7$ denote a degree $7$ del
Pezzo surface. We let $E_{1}, E_{2}$ denote the two disjoint lines on
$S_{7}$ and we let $L \subset S_{7}$ denote the third line on $S_{7}$,
which meets both $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$. Finally, we choose a general
rational normal quintic curve $C \subset S_{7}$ meeting $E_{2}$ at a
single point other than $L \cap E_{2}$.

The base of our first family is
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:B1}
  B_1 = C^{[4]} \simeq \P^{4}.
\end{align}
 $B_1$ carries a good family of cubic surfaces over it.
To see this, one must only note that any length four subscheme
$Z \subset C$ satisfies the property that the three dimensional span
$\langle Z \rangle$ intersects $S_7$ at precisely the scheme
$Z$. Therefore, for each such $Z$, the projection
$p_{\langle Z \rangle}: S_7 \dashrightarrow \P^{3}$ has as image an
irreducible cubic surface.  Furthermore, one can check that each of
these has a finite automorphism group.

The Chern classes of the resulting vector bundle $V$ on
$B_{1} = \P^{4}$ are easily determined. In fact we have:
$v_{1} = -2h$, $v_{2}=h^2$, and $v_{3}= v_{4}=0$, where $h$ denotes
the hyperplane class on the projective space $B_1$.

\subsection{Enumerating cubics in $B_1$}
\label{sec:enum-cubics-b_1}


For $B_1$ to be of any use, we must {\sl a priori} know
$\deg P(v_{1},v_{2},v_{3},v_{4})$ for $B_1$. This is easily
achievable, given basic facts about the configuration of lines on a
general cubic surface. We let
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:nu}
  \nu: M^{\dagger} \to M
  \end{align}
  denote the variety of smooth {\sl marked} cubic surfaces:
  $M^{\dagger}$ parametrizes tuples $(X, E_{1}, \dots, E_{6})$ where
  the $E_{i}$ are six disjoint lines on $X$. It is a classical fact
  that $\deg \nu = 6! \times 72$. The symmetric group $\Sigma_6$ acts
  on $M^{\dagger}$ by permuting the marked lines.

  We claim that the natural rational map to moduli
  $\mu : B_1 \dashrightarrow M$ factors through a birational map
  $\mu^{\dagger}: B_1 \dashrightarrow M^{\dagger}/\Sigma_{4}$, where
  $\Sigma_{4}$ acts by permuting the last four lines
  $E_{3}, \dots, E_{6}$.

Assuming this fact, we arrive at the first relation:

\begin{align}
  \label{eq:relation1}
  16 \cdot a_{1^4} + 4 \cdot a_{1^2 2} + a_{2^2} = 6! \times 3 = 2160.
\end{align}

\section{Family $B_2$}
\label{sec:family-b_2}

Our next family is a slight variant of $B_1$. Let $S$ be a degree $7$
del Pezzo surface, viewed as the blow up of the plane at two points,
with its two exceptional lines $E_1, E_2$ and its third exceptional
line $L$.  Next, fix a general conic $C \subset S$ which is {\sl
  tangent} to $L$ at a point $p$ distinct from the pair
$L \cap (E_1 \cup E_2)$.

The configuration space $C^{[4]} \simeq \P^{4}$ carries a family of
cubic surfaces $X/\P^{4}$.  Unfortunately, the configurations of the
form $x+y+2p$, $x,y \in C$, register reducible cubic surfaces, and so
$X/\P^{4}$ is not good.  This locus is a $2$-plane
$\Lambda \subset \P^{4}$.

\begin{proposition}
  \label{proposition:resolveB2} The blow up of $\P^{4}$ along
  $\Lambda$ carries a good family extending
  $X/(\P^{4} \setminus \Lambda)$.
\end{proposition}
(Actually, hold off: One needs to blow up at least one more time,
corresponding to the configuration $4p$.)
\subsection{Enumerating cubics in $B_2$}
\label{sec:enum-cubics-b_2}

Next we must compute the degree of the map to moduli
$\mu: B_2 \dashrightarrow M$. As in the case of $B_1$, $\mu$ factors
through $\mu^{\dagger}: B_2 \dashrightarrow M^\dagger/\Sigma_{4}$.
However,  there is a distinction:

\begin{proposition}
  \label{proposition:deg-mudagger2}
  We have: $\deg \mu^{\dagger} = 2$.
\end{proposition}

\section{Family $B_3$}
\label{sec:family-b_3}

We construct our third family $B_3$ be starting with a quintic del
Pezzo surface $S$, which is the blow up of the plane at four general
points, and then ``blowing up all pairs of points on $S$.''

The surface $S$ has $10$ exceptional lines $L_{1}, \dots, L_{10}$.  We
let $S^{[2]}$ denote the Hilbert scheme of pairs of points on $S$.
$S^{[2]}$ contains $10$ disjoint $\P^{2}$'s,
$\Lambda_1, \dots, \Lambda_{10}$, namely the Hilbert schemes of pairs
of points contained in the lines $L_{i}$. Let
$\Lambda = \cup_{i}\Lambda_{i}$.

\subsection{Construction of $B_3$}
\label{sec:construction-b_3}

Let $Z \subset S^{[2]} \times S$ denote the universal degree two
subscheme; $Z$ is smooth and the first projection
$\pi_1 : Z \to S^{[2]}$ is finite, flat, and has degree two.



First, observe that the open set
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:UB3}
  U := S^{[2]} \setminus \Lambda
\end{align}
supports a good family of cubic surfaces, namely
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:XUB3}
  X^{\circ} := \Bl_{Z}(S^{[2]} \times S).
\end{align}

(We encourage the reader to check that $X^{\circ}/U$ is indeed good.)

However, when we extend $X^{\circ}$ in the natural way over $S^{[2]}$
the family acquires bad fibers, namely unions of quadrics and planes,
and therefore we must modify $S^{[2]}$ along $\Lambda$.

Let
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:S2tilde}
  \widetilde{S^{[2]}} := \Bl_{\Lambda}S^{[2]}
\end{align}
denote the blow-up with blow-down map
$\beta: \widetilde{S^{[2]}} \to S^{[2]}$.  Let
$E_{i} = \beta^{-1}(\Lambda_{i})$, $i=1, \dots, 10$ denote the
components of the of the exceptional divisor of the blow-up; $\beta$
expresses $E_{i}$ as a $\P^{1}$-bundle over $\Lambda_{i}$.

Next, let $\widetilde{Z} := \widetilde{S^{[2]}} \times_{S^{[2]}} Z$
denote the fiber-product; $\widetilde{Z}$ is a closed subscheme of the
product $\widetilde{S^{[2]}} \times S$, and is a finite, flat, degree
two cover of $\widetilde{S^{[2]}}$ under the first projection
$\tilde{\pi}_{1} : \widetilde{Z} \to \widetilde{S^{[2]}}.$

Inside the product $\widetilde{S^{[2]}} \times S$ we define the
smooth, closed subschemes
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:Fi}
  F_{i} := E_{i} \times L_{i};
\end{align}
we let $F := \cup_{i}F_{i}$.  We perform one more blow-up to get 
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:Xtilde}
  \widetilde{Y} := \Bl_{F}\widetilde{S^{[2]}} \times S.
\end{align}
The natural projection $ Y \to \widetilde{S^{[2]}}$ is a family of
surfaces with simple normal crossing singular fibers over $E_{i}$.
The next lemma is critical.

\begin{lemma}
  The closed immersion
  $\widetilde{Z} \subset \widetilde{S^{[2]}} \times S$ lifts to a
  closed immersion $\widetilde{Z} \subset Y$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  The main observation is that we have an equality of schemes
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:Cartier}
    F_i \cap \widetilde{Z} = \widetilde{\pi}_{1}^{-1}(E_i) \cap \widetilde{Z}
  \end{align}
  for all $i=1, \dots, 10$, {\sl and therefore $F \cap \widetilde{Z}$
    is a Cartier divisor on $\widetilde{Z}$}. The claim now follows
  from a basic property of blow-ups.
\end{proof}



We can finally define our proposed family of cubics.  We let
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:XB3}
  X := \Bl_{\widetilde{Z}}Y
\end{align}
denote the blow-up,
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:phiB3}
  \varphi: X \to Y
\end{align}
the blow-down map, and
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:piB3}
  \pi: X \to \widetilde{S^{[2]}}
\end{align}
the natural projection. 
\begin{proposition}
  \label{proposition:resolv-b3}
 The family 
\end{proposition}

(This one I still am confident in -- one simple blow-up resolves the situation.)

\section{Family $B_4$}
\label{sec:family-b_4}

For this family, we fix a degree $6$ del Pezzo surface $S$, the blow
up of the plane at three non-collinear points, and then we fix a
general ``line'' (which is really a twisted cubic) $L$ in $S$ disjoint
from the three points blown up.  An open subset $U$ of the variety
$L \times L \times S$ carries a good family of cubic surfaces in the
obvious way. However, as in the case of $B_3$, the complement of $U$
is a union of surfaces which need to be blown up before obtaining a
good family of cubic surfaces.
