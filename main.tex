\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

\subsection{Counting cubic surfaces}\label{sec:counting}
Cubic surfaces have fascinated us for centuries. Ever since Cayley and
Salmon discovered the 27 lines, a long list of
algebraic geometers have revealed beautiful facets of their geometry,
using increasingly sophisticated tools. We add to this
development by answering a family of natural enumerative questions
about families of cubic surfaces.

The isomorphism classes of cubic surfaces form a 4-dimensional moduli
space. So, we expect that in a 4-dimensional family, a general
isomorphism class would appear finitely many times. How do we
determine this number? For example, how many times does a general
cubic surface appear, up to isomorphism, as
\begin{enumerate}[(A)]
\item \label{orbit} a member of a 4-dimensional general linear system of cubic surfaces in $\mathbb
  P^3$?
\item \label{slice} a hyperplane section of a general cubic threefold in $\mathbb
  P^4$?
\item a blow up of 6 points in $\P^2$ varying in a general
  4-dimensional linear system on a cubic curve?
\end{enumerate}
We prove an enumerative formula that answers all questions of this kind.
(The answers to these specific questions are $96120$, $42120$, and
$25920$, respectively).

To state our theorem, we must fix a precise moduli space for the
cubics.  Let us denote by $\mathcal M$ the GIT quotient of the set of
semi-stable cubic surfaces in $\P^3$ by the action of
$\PGL(4)$.  By a family of cubic surfaces, we mean a flat, proper
morphism whose geometric fibers are isomorphic to cubic surfaces in
$\P^3$.

\begin{theorem}\label{theorem:main}
  Let $B$ be proper and let $\pi \colon X \to B$ be a good family of
  cubic surfaces. Let $\V$ be the rank 4 bundle
  $\V = \pi_* \left(\omega_\pi^{-1}\right)$, and let
  \(v_i = c_i\left(\V\right)\) be its Chern classes.  Assume that a
  general fiber of $\pi$ is semi-stable, and let
  $\mu \colon B \dashrightarrow \mathcal M$ be the rational map
  induced by $\pi$.  Then we have the equality
  \begin{align}
    \deg \mu =
    \label{eq:MAIN}
    1080 \int_{B} \left(v_{1}^{2}v_{2} - v_{1}v_{3}+ 9v_{4}\right).
  \end{align}
\end{theorem}
\autoref{def:goodfamily} gives the precise meaning of ``good''.  This
notion includes all families whose fibers are GIT-semistable or have a
finite automorphism group.

\subsection{Degree of the orbit closure}
Question~\ref{orbit} in \autoref{sec:counting} fits in a broader
story that has been an ongoing topic of study.
Consider a hypersurface \(X\) in a projective space $\P V$ cut out by
a homogeneous polynomial $F \in \Sym^d V$.
In $\P\Sym^dV$, consider the orbit of $[F]$ under the action of
$\GL(V)$, and let $\Orb([F])$ be its closure.
In a series of seminal papers, Aluffi and Faber computed the degree of
$\Orb([F])$ when \(F\) is a homogeneous polynomial in 2 or 3 variables,
that is, when \(X\) is a set of points in $\P^1$ or a curve
in $\P^2$ \cite{alu.fab:00,alu.fab:93,alu.fab:93*1}.
The next unknown case is that of cubic surfaces in $\P^3$.
The answer to Question~\ref{orbit} says that the degree of the
orbit closure of a general cubic surface is $96120$.

Question~\ref{orbit} appears as one of the ``twenty-seven questions
about the cubic surface'' by Ranestad and Sturmfels \cite{ran.stu:20}.
In 2019, Brustenga i Moncus\'i, Timme, and Weinstein gave a
``numerical proof'' for the number 96120. In 2020, Cazzador and
Skauli outlined an approach towards a proof by following the
techniques of Aluffi and Faber \cite{bru-i-mon.tim.wei:20,caz.ska:20}.
Our approach is different.

\subsection{The equivariant class of the orbit closure}
Our key idea is to consider not just the degree of the orbit closure,
but the class of the orbit closure in the equivariant Chow ring
$A^\bullet_{\GL V}(\Sym^dV)$. The equivariant class subsumes the
degree. Somewhat counter-intuitively, finding it turns out to be easier
than finding the degree.

Let us explain how the equivariant class yields the degree.
We have natural maps
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
  A^\bullet_{\GL V}(\Sym^dV) \ar{r}& A^\bullet_{\GL V}(\Sym^d V \setminus
  \{0\}) \otimes \Q \ar[equal]{d}\\
  &A^\bullet_{\PGL V}(\P \Sym^dV) \otimes \Q \ar{r}&
  A^\bullet(\P \Sym^dV) \otimes \Q.
\end{tikzcd}
\]
Under the composite map, the class of $\Orb(F) \in A^\bullet_{\GL
  V}(\Sym^dV)$ is mapped to the class of $\Orb([F]) \in
A^\bullet(\P \Sym^dV) \otimes \Q$, which is simply the degree of $\Orb([F])$.

Let us explain what makes it possible to find the equivariant
class.  The ring $A^\bullet_{\GL V}(\Sym^dV)$ is the polynomial ring
in variables $c_1, \dots, c_r$, where $r = \dim V$, and the variable
$c_i$ has degree $i$.  The equivariant class of $\Orb(F)$ lies in the
graded component $A^m(\Sym^dV)$, where
$m = \dim \Sym^d V - \dim \GL V$.  As a result, it can be expressed as
a $\mathbb Z$-linear combination of monomials in $c_i$ of total degree
$m$. We can now use the method of undetermined coefficients.  We
construct maps $B \to [\Sym^dV/\GL V]$ where the pull-back of
$\Orb(F)$ as well as the classes $c_i$ can be explicitly
computed. Every such family gives a linear relationship between the
coefficients in the expression of $\Orb(F)$, which are to be determined.
If we have enough families, we get enough information to find all the coefficients.
For cubic surfaces, we construct more than enough families---there are 5
coefficients to be determined and we construct 9 families. The redundancy
serves as an extra check on the result.
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:eqvclass}
  Let $V$ be a 4-dimensional vector space and let $F$ be a general
  element of $\Sym^3 V$.
  The equivariant class of the $\GL(V)$-orbit closure $\Orb(F)$ of $F$
  in $A^\bullet_{\GL V}(\Sym^3 V)$ is given by
  \[
    [\Orb F] = 24c_1^4 + 12c_1^2c_2 - 6c_1c_3 + 9c_4,
  \]
  where the \(c_i = c_i(V)\) are the Chern classes of the tautological vector
  bundle $V$.
\end{theorem}
The formula in \autoref{thm:eqvclass} appears to be different from the one
in \autoref{theorem:main}, but they are related by a simple change of
variables.

Most of the paper is devoted to constructing good families of cubic
surfaces on which we can compute $\deg \mu$ and the Chern classes
$c_i$. The bases $B$ in our families are $\P^4$, $\overline
M_{0,7}$, a Hassett-weighted variant of $\overline M_{0,7}$, a blow
up of the Hilbert scheme of two points on a quintic del Pezzo surface,
and last but not the least, the stack $B\G_m$.

The method of undetermined coefficients applies to hypersurfaces of
any degree and dimension.  The obstacle is constructing enough
families.

\subsection{Further remarks}
The formula in \autoref{theorem:main} has some curious consequences.
\begin{corollary}
  \label{cor:ineq} If $\pi \colon X \to B$ is a good family of cubic
  surfaces parametrized by a $4$ dimensional proper variety $B$,
  then $$\int_{B} v_{1}^{2}v_{2} - v_{1}v_3 + 9v_{4} \geq 0$$ with
  equality holding if and only if a general cubic surface does not
  arise as a fiber.
\end{corollary}

\begin{corollary}
  \label{cor:ineq} Let $\pi \colon X \to B$ is a good family of cubic
  surfaces parametrized by a $4$ dimensional proper variety $B$.
  Assume that a general fiber of $\pi$ is smooth and the induced map
  $\mu \colon B \dashrightarrow \mathcal M$ is dominant.
  Then the degree of $\mu$ is divisible by 1080.
\end{corollary}
In particular, a parameter space for cubic surfaces that carries a
universal family must cover $\mathcal M$ by a map of degree divisible
by 1080.
Interestingly, the number 1080 is also the least common multiple of the
orders of the finite groups that arise as automorphism groups of cubic surfaces.

\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sec:good}

In this chapter, we introduce the notion of a good family of cubic surfaces (\autoref{def:goodfamily}) and provide a tool (\autoref{prop:good}) to verify that a family is good.  Before we do so, we first establish notation and recall some classical facts about cubic surfaces.

\subsection{Notation and conventions}
\label{sec:notation-conventions}
Fix an algebraically closed field $\k$ of characteristic zero.
In this paper, a `scheme' means `a scheme of finite type over $\k$' and a `point' means a `$\k$-point', unless explicitly stated otherwise.
We do not distinguish between a vector bundle and the associated locally free sheaf of its sections.

Given a map of schemes $\pi \colon X \to Y$ and a point $y \in Y$, we let $X_y$ denote the fiber scheme $\pi^{-1}(y)$.  If $\pi$ is proper and Gorenstein, we write $\omega_{X/Y}$ or $\omega_\pi$ for the dualizing line bundle.  If $X$ and $Y$ are themselves Gorenstein and $\pi$ is flat, then we have $\omega_{X/Y} = \omega_X \otimes \pi^*\omega_Y^{-1}$.

Given a vector bundle $\mathcal W$, we let $\P \mathcal W$ be its projectivization.  Contrary to Grothendieck's convention, $\P \mathcal W$ parametrizes $1$-dimensional subspaces in the fibers of $\mathcal W$.  In other words, we set
\[ \P \mathcal W = \Proj \Sym(\mathcal W^\vee).\]
As a result, $\P \mathcal W$ comes equipped with a line bundle $\O(1)$ whose push-forward to the base is $\mathcal W^\vee$.

Let $Q \subset \P V$ be a non-degenerate quadric.  The bilinear form associated to $Q$ gives an isomorphism of $\P V$ with the dual projective space $\P V^\vee$.  Given a point $p \in \P V$, we denote by $\Polar(p) \subset \P V$ the hyperplane dual to $p$ with respect to $Q$. Similarly, given a hyperplane $H \subset \P V$, we denote by $\Pole(H) \in \P V$ the point dual to $H$  with respect to $Q$.  In almost all cases, we use these constructions when $\P V$ is $\P^2$.

\subsection{Cubic surfaces and their moduli}
\label{sec:classical-facts}
Let $\pi \colon X \to B$ be a family of cubic surfaces.
That is, let $\pi$ be a flat, proper morphism whose fibers are isomorphic to cubic hypersurfaces in $\P^3$.
Since $\pi$ is flat and its fibers are Gorenstein, it is a Gorenstein morphism, and hence admits a dualizing line bundle $\omega_\pi$.
By the adjunction formula, it follows that the restriction of $\omega_{\pi}^{-1}$ to every fiber is isomorphic to the restriction of $\O(1)$ with respect to an embedding of the fiber as a cubic hypersurface in $\P^3$.
By standard theorems about cohomology and base-change, it follows that $R^i\pi_* \left(\omega_{\pi}^{-1}\right)$ vanishes for $i > 0$, and is a vector bundle for $i = 0$.
Set
\[ \mathcal V = \pi_* \left( \omega_\pi^{-1} \right).\]
The natural map 
\[ \pi^*\mathcal V \to \omega_{\pi}^{-1}\]
yields a closed embedding
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:relcanx}
  X \subset \P \mathcal V^\vee.
\end{equation}
We know that
\[ \omega_{\P \mathcal V^\vee/B} = \O(-4) \otimes \det \mathcal V^\vee,\]
and hence, by adjunction,
\[ \omega_{X/B}= \O(-4) \otimes \O(X) \otimes \det \mathcal V^\vee |_X.\]
By construction, we also have
\[ \omega_{X/B} = \O(-1)|_X,\]
and hence we obtain that
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:ox}
  \O(X) = \O(3) \otimes \det \mathcal V.
\end{equation}
In other words, $X \subset \P \mathcal V^\vee$ is the zero locus of a section of the line bundle $\O(3) \otimes \det \mathcal V^\vee$.

Consider the category $\mathscr {C}$ fibered in groupoids over the category of schemes whose objects over a scheme $B$ are families of cubic surfaces $\pi \colon X \to B$, and whose morphisms are pull-back diagrams.
Consider the category $\mathscr {M}$ fibered in groupoids over the category of schemes whose objects over a scheme $B$ are vector bundles $\mathcal V$ over $B$ of rank 4 along with a nowhere zero section $\xi$ of $\Sym^3 \mathcal V^\vee \otimes \det \mathcal V$, and whose morphisms are pull-back diagrams.
Let $V$ be a $\k$-vector space of dimension 4.
Note that $\mathscr{M}$ is simply the quotient stack
\[\mathscr{M} = \left[\Sym^3 V^\vee \otimes \det V \setminus \{0\} / \GL V \right]. \]
\begin{proposition}
  The category $\mathscr{C}$ of families of cubic surfaces is equivalent to the category $\mathscr{M}$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  Let $\pi \colon X \to B$ be a family of cubic surfaces, and set $\mathcal V = \pi_* \left( \omega_{\pi}^{-1} \right)$.
  Consider the relative canonical embedding $X \subset \P \mathcal V^\vee$.
  In this embedding, $X$ is cut out by a section of $\O(3) \otimes \det \mathcal V$ on $\P \mathcal V^\vee$, or equivalently, by a section of $\xi$ of  $\Sym^3V^\vee \otimes \det \mathcal V$ on $B$.
  Since $\pi$ is flat, $\xi$ is nowhere zero on $B$.
  We thus have a natural transformation from $\mathscr{C}$ to $\mathscr{M}$.

  To go from $\mathscr{M}$ to $\mathscr{C}$, given a rank 4 bundle $\mathcal V$ and a nowhere section $\xi$ of $\Sym^3 \mathcal V^\vee \otimes \det \mathcal V$, define $X \subset \P \mathcal V^\vee$ as the zero-locus of the corresponding section of $\O(3) \otimes \det \mathcal V$.
\end{proof}

We call $\mathscr{M}$ the \emph{moduli stack of cubic surfaces}.
Sometimes, it will be convenient to add in the zero section and consider the bigger stack
\[ \mathscr{M}^* = \left[\Sym^3 V^\vee \otimes \det V / \GL V \right].\]
Note that the diagonal $\G_m \subset \GL V$ acts by weight $-1$ on $\Sym^3 V^\vee \otimes \det V$.
In particular, its action is free.
Therefore, the stack $\mathscr{M}$ is isomorphic to the quotient stack
\[ \mathscr{M} = \left[ \P \Sym^3V^\vee / \PGL V \right].\]

We let $\mathcal M$ denote the GIT quotient of $\P \Sym^3V^\vee$ by the action of $\PGL V$.
Mumford describes the semi-stable and stable locus of the action; see \cite{MFK} or \cite{StabProjVar}.

\begin{theorem}[Cayley, Salmon]
  \label{theorem:cayleysalmon} Every smooth cubic surface contains
  exactly $27$ lines.
\end{theorem}

An ordered tuple of six lines $(\ell_1, \dots, \ell_6)$ on a cubic
surface is called a {\sl six} if they are pairwise disjoint.  An
unordered pair of sixes
$\{(\ell_1, \dots, \ell_6), (\ell_1', \dots, \ell_6')\}$ is called a
{\sl double-six} if
\begin{itemize}
\item $\ell_{i}$ and $\ell'_{i}$ are disjoint for all $i$, and
\item $\ell_{i}$ and $\ell'_{j}$ meet at a point whenever $i \neq j$.
  \end{itemize}

\begin{theorem}[Schl\"{a}fli]
  \label{theorem:schlafli} Each six on a smooth cubic surface has a
  unique extension to a double-six, and every smooth cubic surface
  contains $36$ double-sixes.
\end{theorem}

\subsubsection{Moduli spaces of cubic surfaces}
\label{sec:modulispacescubic}
We let $\M$ denote the {\sl coarse moduli space of cubic surfaces},
obtained by taking the GIT quotient of the linear system of cubic
surfaces in $\P^3$ by the action of $\Aut(\P^3) = \PGL_{4}(\k)$. By
the classical calculation of invariants \cite[], we know that $\M$ is
a $4$ dimensional variety isomorphic to the weighted projective space
$\P(1,2,3,4,5)$.

We let $\M^{\dagger}$ denote the {\sl moduli space
  of marked cubic surfaces} which parametrizes pairs
$(S, \underline{\ell})$ where $\underline{\ell}$ is a six on a smooth
cubic surface $S \subset \P^3$, taken up to the action of
$\Aut(\P^3)$.  There is a natural quasi-finite, dominant forgetful
morphism
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:modulispaces}
  \sigma: \M^{\dagger} \to \M\\
  (S, \underline{\ell}) \mapsto S. \nonumber
\end{align}

\autoref{theorem:schlafli} implies that
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:degreesigma}
  \deg (\sigma) = 72 \times 6! = 51840.
\end{align}


\begin{theorem}[Schubert]
  \label{theorem:Schubert} There are $20$ cuspidal cubic curves
  containing all of five general points in $\P^{2}$, and flexed at a
  sixth general point.
\end{theorem}


\subsection{Good families}
\label{sec:good-families}

Let $E$ denote a four dimensional $\k$-vector space, and hereafter fix
a {\sl general} degree $3$ form $F \in \Sym^{3}E^{\smvee}$.  Let
$$\Orb(F) \subset \P \Sym^{3}E^{\smvee} \simeq \P^{19}$$
denote the $\GL(E)$-orbit closure of the point $[F]$.  We let
$$\partial \Orb(F) = \Orb(F) \setminus \GL(E) \cdot [F]$$
denote the {\sl boundary}, i.e. the complement of the orbit of $[F]$
in its closure. $\Orb(F)$ is a $15$ dimensional variety whose singular
locus lies in the proper subvariety $\partial \Orb(F)$. 

\begin{definition}
\label{def:goodfamily}
Let $\pi :X \to B$ be a flat, projective morphism of relative
dimension $2$, with $B$ a $4$-dimensional scheme. We say $\pi$ is {\sl
  a good family of cubic surfaces} if:
\begin{itemize}
\item There exists a $\P^3$-bundle $\rho: P \to B$ and a closed
  embedding $\iota: X \hookrightarrow P$ embedding each fiber $X_b$,
  $b \in B$, as a cubic surface in $P_b$ and $\pi = \rho \circ \iota$,
\item There does {\sl not} exist a $b \in B$ such that the cubic
  surface $X_b$ is represented by a point in
  $\partial \Orb(F) \subset \P^{19}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

The base $B$ of a good family carries the {\sl natural} rank $4$
vector bundle
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:V}
  \V := \pi_{*}\omega_{X/B}^{-1}.
\end{align}
Furthermore, assuming the general fiber of $\pi$ is smooth, $B$ admits
a rational map
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:mu}
  \mu: B \dashrightarrow \M
\end{align}
to the coarse moduli variety of cubic surfaces
$\mathcal{M} := \Sym^{3}E^{\smvee} \sslash GL(E)$.




\begin{definition}
  \label{def:admissible} A length $6$ subscheme $Z \subset \P^{2}$
  with ideal sheaf $\mathcal{I}_{Z}$ is {\sl admissible} if:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $Z$ is curvilinear, i.e $Z$ is contained in a smooth curve,
  \item $h^{0}(\mathcal{I}_Z(3)) = 4$, and
  \item $Z$ is the scheme cut out by the vector space of cubics
    $H^0(\P^2, \mathcal{I}_Z(3))$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:cubicZ} Let $Z \subset \P^2$ be an admissible length $6$
  subscheme.  The {\sl cubic surface associated to $Z$}, denoted
  $X_Z \subset \P^3$ is the image of the anti-canonical map
  $\kappa: \Bl_{Z}\P^2 \to \P^3$ induced by the linear system
  $H^0(\P^2,\mathcal{I}_Z(3))$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
  \label{prop:good} Let $Z \subset \P^2$ be an admissible, length $6$
  subscheme with $X_Z \subset \P^3$ its associated cubic surface. Then
  $\dim \Aut(\P^2,Z) > 0$ if and only if $\dim \Aut(\P^3,X_Z) > 0$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof} The implication
  $\dim \Aut(\P^2,Z) > 0 \implies \dim \Aut(\P^3,X_Z) > 0$ is simpler:
  Any automorphism $g \in \Aut(\P^2,Z)$ naturally lifts to an
  automorphism $g' \in \Aut \Bl_{Z}\P^2$. This latter automorphism
  must preserve the anti-canonical line bundle
  $\omega_{\Bl_{Z}(\P^2)}^{-1}$, and therefore induces an element in
  $\Aut(\P^3, X_Z)$. This element is nontrivial if $g$ is, because
  $\kappa: \Bl_{Z}(\P^2) \to X_Z$ is birational. The implication
  follows.


  The opposite implication
  $\dim \Aut(\P^3,X_Z) > 0 \implies \dim \Aut(\P^2,Z) > 0$ is more
  intricate. First, note that $\Bl_{Z}\P^2$ is a surface with finitely
  many $A_n$ singularities, thanks to the curvilinearity of $Z$; let
  $\tau: Y \to \Bl_{Z}\P^2$ denote its minimal desingularization.
  Since $A_n$ singularities are canonical, we conclude that
  $\tau^{*}(\omega_{\Bl_{Z}\P^2}) = \omega_{Y}$.  The composite
  $\kappa':= \kappa \circ \tau: Y \to X_{Z}$ can only contract a curve
  $C \subset Y$ to a singular point of $X_Z$.  This follows because   
  $\kappa'^{*}\omega_{X_{Z}} = \omega_{Y}$. Thus,
  $\kappa': \kappa'^{-1}(X_{Z}^{sm}) \to X_{Z}^{sm}$ is an
  isomorphism. Our claim is that $\kappa':Y \to X_{Z}$ is also the
  minimal desingularization of $X_Z$.

  Since $Y$ is {\sl some} desingularization of $X_Z$,
  $\kappa':Y \to X_{Z}$ factors through the minimal desingularization
  $\widetilde{X_{Z}} \to X_{Z}$ of $X_{Z}$; let
  $\alpha: Y \to \widetilde{X_{Z}}$ denote the induced map. $\alpha$
  is a birational morphism between smooth surfaces. Therefore, if it
  is not biregular, there must be a smooth $(-1)$ rational curve
  $E \subset Y$ contracted by $\alpha$.  Since $\omega_{Y}$ is pulled
  back from $\widetilde{X_{Z}}$, it follows that $\omega_{Y}|_{E}$ is
  trivial. This, along with $E \cdot E = -1$, contradicts the
  adjunction formula.  Hence $\alpha$ is an isomorphism.

  Every automorphism of a surface lifts uniquely to its minimal
  desingularization. Therefore, if $\dim \Aut(\P^3,X_Z) >0 $, it
  follows that $\dim \Aut(Y) >0$. Under this assumption, let
  $G \subset \Aut(Y)$ denote the connected component containing
  identity.

  The Picard group $\Pic(Y)$ is discrete, so the connected group $G$
  acts trivially on $\Pic(Y)$.  In particular, the line bundle $L$ on
  $\Bl_{Z}\P^2$ inducing the morphism $Y \to \Bl_{Z}\P^2 \to \P^2$ is
  preserved by $G$. Therefore, $G$ induces an action on
  $\P H^0(Y,L)= \P^2$.  This action renders the blow-down map
  $\Bl_{Z}\P^2 \to \P^2$ $G$-equivariant, from which it follows that
  the action of $G$ on $\P^2$ preserves the subscheme $Z$, which is
  what we sought to show.

  
\end{proof}

\section{Family $B_1$}
\label{sec:first-test-family}

In this section, we construct a good family over $B_{1} = \P^{4}$.
Let $S$ denote the blow up of $\P^{2}$ at two points $y_1,y_2$. We let
$E_{1}, E_{2}$ denote the corresponding exceptional lines on $S$ and
we let $L \subset S$ denote the proper transform of a line in $\P^2$
passing through the two points $y_1,y_2$. Finally, we pick a general
conic through $y_{2}$ and let $C \subset S$ denote its proper
transform. Let $\omega_{S}^{-1}$ denote the anti-canonical line bundle
on $S$.  

\subsection{Construction of $B_1$}
\label{sec:construction-b_1}


The base of our first family is
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:B1}
  B_1 := \Hilb^{4}C \simeq \P^{4}.
\end{align}
$B_1$ carries a good family of cubic surfaces over it.  In short, to
each degree $4$ divisor $Z \subset C$, we assign the cubic surface
$X_{Z}$ which is the image of $\Bl_{Z}S$ under its anti-canonical
map. The following proposition justifies this construction:

\begin{proposition}
  \label{prop:B1} Let $Z \subset S$ be any length $4$ subscheme of $C$
  with ideal sheaf $\mathcal{I}_{Z} \subset \mathcal{O}_{S}$. Then
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $h^{0}(S, \mathcal{I}_{Z} \otimes \omega_{S}^{-1}) = 4$, and
  \item $Z \subset S$ is the subscheme defined by the vector space of
    sections $H^{0}(S, \mathcal{I}_{Z} \otimes \omega_{S}^{-1})$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  We translate (1) and (2) into geometric statements about the
  anti-canonical embedding $S \subset \P^{7}$.  The line bundle
  $\omega_{S}^{-1}(-C)$ on $S$ is basepoint free, as its divisor class
  is represented by proper transforms of lines through
  $y_{1} \in \P^2$, which become separated in the blow up.  The
  geometric consequence of this is: {\sl If
    $\langle C \rangle \simeq \P^5 \subset \P^7$ is the linear span of
    $C$, then $\langle C \rangle \cap S = C$, scheme theoretically.}

  Now $C$ is a rational normal quintic curve in its span
  $\langle C \rangle$. The following is a basic fact about rational
  normal curves: {\sl Every length $m \leq n$ subscheme of rational
    normal curve of degree $n$ spans a linear space of dimension $m-1$
    which, in turn, intersects the rational normal curve precisely at
    the length $m$ scheme.}  Both (1) and (2) follow directly from
  this.
\end{proof}

Let $\mathcal{Z} \subset B_1 \times C$ denote the universal
length $4$ subscheme, and consider $\mathcal{Z}$ as a closed subscheme
of the product $B_1 \times S$. Let $\pi_{1}, \pi_{2}$ denote the
projections of $B_1 \times S$ to its respective factors.
Then we set
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:X1}
  X' := \Bl_{\mathcal{Z}} \left( B_1 \times S \right).
\end{align}
Abusing notation, we continue to let $\pi_{1}$ and $\pi_{2}$ denote
the natural maps from $X'$ to $B_1$ and $S$, respectively.  We
let $E \subset X'$ denote the exceptional divisor over $\mathcal{Z}$.


Consider the line bundle
$\mathcal{L} := \pi_{2}^{*}\omega_{S}^{-1} (-E) =
\omega_{X'/B_{1}}^{-1}$ on $X'$.  By \autoref{prop:B1},
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:V1}
  \V := \pi_{1 *}\mathcal{L}
\end{align}
is a rank $4$ vector bundle on $B_1$, and the canonical evaluation map
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:eval1}
  \pi_{1}^{*}\V \to \mathcal{L}
\end{align}
is surjective.  Therefore, we obtain a map
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:X11}
  \kappa: X' \to \P \V^{\smvee}
\end{align}
whose image $X := \kappa(X')$ is a family of cubic surfaces
parametrized by $B_1$.  Let $\pi: X \to B_1$ denote the natural map.
By tracing through the construction, one can see that the vector
bundle $\V$ is equal to $\pi_{*} \omega_{X/B_1}'$, i.e. $\V$ is the
natural bundle for $\pi: X \to B_1$.

\subsection{Chern classes of $\V$}
\label{sec:chern-classes-b_1}

In order to calculate the Chern classes of $\V$, we express it as an
extension of a trivial rank $2$ vector bundle by the Lazarsfeld-Mukai
bundle on $B_1$ associated to the line bundle
$\omega_{S}^{-1}|_{C}$. By identifying the conic $C$ with $\P^{1}$,
this latter line bundle is $\O_{\P^{1}}(5)$ -- we will switch back and
forth between $C$ and $\P^{1}$ in what follows.  We also identify
$B_{1}$ with $\P^{4}$.


The trivial sub-bundle of $\V$ arises as follows: The fiber $\V_{[Z]}$
over a point $[Z] \in B_1$, corresponding to a subscheme
$Z \subset C$, is the vector space
$H^{0}(S, \mathcal{I}_{Z} \otimes \omega_{S}^{-1})$.  The latter
vector space contains the fixed $2$ dimensional vector space
$H^{0}(S, \omega_{S}^{-1}(-C))$.  This yields a $2$-dimensional
trivial subbundle of $\V$, whose quotient we denote by $\mathcal{K}$.


The bundle $\mathcal{K}$ is naturally identified with the kernel in
the exact sequence
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:LM}
  0 \to \mathcal{K} \to H^{0}(\P^1, \O_{\P^{1}}(5)) \otimes \O_{\P^4} \to \O_{\P^{1}}(5)^{[4]} \to 0 
\end{align}

Here, the rank four bundle $\O_{\P^{1}}(5)^{[4]}$ is the tautological
bundle whose fiber over a point $[Z] \in B_{1}$, corresponding to a
length $4$ subscheme $Z \subset \P^{1}$, is the vector space
$H^{0}(Z, \O_{\P^{1}}(5)|_{Z})$.  The map on the right side of
\eqref{eq:LM} is simply restriction of sections.

It is an easy exercise to show that
$\mathcal{K} \simeq \O_{\P^{4}}(-1) \oplus \O_{\P^{4}}(-1)$.  The
following lemma summarizes the relevant Chern class computations of
$\V$ -- for brevity's sake, we equate a $0$-cycle with its degree.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lemma:chernB1}
  For the natural bundle $\V$ over $B_1= \P^{4}$, we have:
  \begin{align}\nonumber
    v_{1}^{4} = 16,\\\nonumber
    v_{1}^{2}v_{2} = 4,\\\nonumber
    v_{1}v_{3} =0,\\\nonumber
    v_2^{2} = 1,\\\nonumber
    v_{4} = 0.
  \end{align}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  By the Whitney sum formula, the Chern classes of $\V$ are
  $v_{1} = -2h$, $v_{2}=h^2$, and $v_{3}= v_{4}=0$, where $h$ denotes
  the hyperplane class on the projective space $B_1 = \P^{4}$.
\end{proof}









\subsection{Enumerating cubics in $B_1$}
\label{sec:enum-cubics-b_1}


\begin{figure}[!]
  \centering
%  \incfig{FamilyB1}
  \caption{Schematic for the family parametrized by $B_1$. The points
    $Z$ vary freely on the conic $C$, and we blow up the plane at the
    six points $Z \cup \{y_{1},y_{2}\}$.}
    \label{fig:FamilyB1}
\end{figure}


For $B_1$ to be of any use, we must {\sl a priori} know the degree of
the map to moduli $\mu: B_1 \dashrightarrow \M$.  First note that
$\mu$ factors through the quasi-finite, degree
$72 \times \frac{6!}{4!}$ cover $\M^{\dagger}/S_{4} \to \M$.  Here,
the symmetric group $S_4$ acts by permuting the last four lines in a
six $(\ell_{1}, \dots, \ell_{6})$ on a cubic surface.


The moduli map $\mu: B_{1} \dashrightarrow \M$ naturally factors
through a map $\mu': B_1 \dashrightarrow \M^{\dagger}/S_{4}$ by
sending a general subscheme $Z \subset C$ to the marked cubic surface
$(\Bl_{Z}S, E_1, E_2, E_{Z})$. Here, $E_Z$ denotes the union of four
exceptional lines above the points of $Z$.


Thus, in order to compute $\deg \mu$, we merely need to compute
$\deg \mu'$.

  \begin{lemma}
    \label{lemma:degreemudaggerB1}
    $\mu': B_1 \dashrightarrow \M^{\dagger}/S_{4}$ has degree $2$.
  \end{lemma}

  \begin{proof}
    Beginning with a general marked cubic surface
    $(X, \ell_{1}, \ell_2, \dots, \ell_{6})$ we can blow down the six
    to produce a map $\varphi: X \to \P^2$. The map $\varphi$ is only
    well-defined up to the action of $\Aut(\P^{2})$.  By composing
    with an automorphism, we may assume that
    $\varphi(\ell_{1}) = y_{1}$ and $\varphi(\ell_{2}) = y_{2}$.

    The $4$ dimensional subgroup $H \subset \Aut(\P^{2})$ fixing the
    points $y_{1}, y_{2}$ acts on the $\P^{4}$ of conics passing
    through $y_{2}$. Let $G \subset H$ denote the stabilizer of $C$,
    viewed as a conic through $y_{2}$.  We will now show that $|G|=2$,
    from which the lemma follows.

    Any automorphism $h \in H$ preserving $C$ must fix the three
    points $y_{1},y_{2}$ and the point
    $y_{3}:= (\overline{y_{1},y_{2}} \cap C) \setminus \{y_{2}\}.$
    Therefore, $h$ must also fix $p := \Pole(y_{2},y_{3}) \in \P^{2}$.
    At the same time, $h$ must preserve the un-ordered pair of points
    $\Polar(y_{1}) \subset C$. It is now a simple exercise to see that
    there is a unique involution on $\P^{2}$ fixing $p$, preserving
    $C$ and interchanging the points of $\Polar(y_{1})$. Hence
    $|G|=2$, as desired.
  \end{proof}




\subsection{Goodness}
\label{sec:goodness1}

\begin{proposition}
  \label{prop:B1good}
  The family $\pi: X \to B_1$ is good.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  We use \autoref{prop:good}. If $[Z] \in B_{1}$ is any point,
  corresponding to a length $4$ subscheme $Z \subset C$, we
  immediately get a length $6$ admissible subscheme (see \cite[] )
  $Z' \subset \P^2$ by the rule
  \begin{align*}
    Z' = (Z+y_2) \cup \{y_{1}\}.
  \end{align*}
  Here, we view $C$ as a conic in $\P^{2}$ containing $y_{2}$, and the
  sum in $Z + y_{2}$ is as divisors on $C$.  The cubic surface
  $X_{[Z]} = \pi^{-1}([Z])$ is the same as the cubic surface $X_{Z'}$
  associated to $Z'$.

  In order to use \autoref{prop:good}, we next verify that the group
  $\Aut(\P^{2},Z')$ is finite.  First observe that $C \subset \P^{2}$
  must be the unique conic containing the length $5$ subscheme
  $ Z + y_{2} \subset Z'$.  Therefore, any element
  $h \in \Aut(\P^{2},Z')$ must preserve $C$.  As $y_{1}$ does not lie
  on $C$, we conclude that $h(y_{1}) = y_{1}$, and therefore $h$ must
  preserve the pair of points $\Polar(y_{1}) \subset C$. Furthermore,
  if we assume $h$ also fixes $y_{2}$, which we can do by passing to
  the connected component of the identity element in
  $\Aut(\P^{2},Z')$, then $h$ would have to preserve three distinct
  points on $C$, from which finiteness follows.
\end{proof}


\subsection{First relation}
\label{sec:firstrelation}

The results in this section, taken together, yield the following
relation on the indetermined coefficients in \eqref{eq:P}:
  

\begin{align}
  \label{eq:relation1}
  16 \cdot a_{1^4} + 4 \cdot a_{1^2 2} + a_{2^2} = 72 \times \frac{6!}{4!} \times 2 = 4320.
\end{align}

\section{Family $B_2$}
\label{sec:family-b_2}


This section constructs and analyzes a good family over the base
$$B_2 := \overline{\M}_{0,7},$$
the moduli space of Deligne-Mumford stable $7$-pointed genus $0$
curves.  To avoid unnecessary accumulation of symbols, we reset
notation such as $C,S,X, \dots$ from previous sections, and start
anew.



Before diving into details, we summarize the construction. Let
$C \subset \P^{2}$ be a smooth conic with $7$ distinct marked points
$s_{0}, s_{1}, \dots, s_{5}, s_{\infty}$ on $C$, and let
$t \in \P^{2} \setminus C$ denote the intersection point of the
tangent lines of $C$ at $s_{0}$ and $s_{\infty}$, i.e.
$t = \Pole(s_{0},s_{\infty})$.  Then the scheme
$Z := \{s_{1}, \dots , s_{5}, t \}$ is an admissible length $6$
subscheme of $\P^{2}$, and its associated cubic surface $X_{Z}$ has a
finite automorphism group.  The main objective of this section is to
demonstrate how this construction {\sl can be extended over the
  boundary of $\overline{\M}_{0,7}$, yielding a good family of cubic
  surfaces.}

\subsection{Basics of $\overline{\M}_{0,7}$}
\label{sec:basics-overlinem_0-7}

We denote a general stable $7$-pointed genus zero curve by
$$(C, s_{0}, s_{1}, \dots, s_{5}, s_{\infty}),$$
and we let 
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:PM07}
  \varphi: \mathcal{C} \to \overline{\M}_{0,7}
\end{align}
denote the universal stable curve, with universal marking sections
denoted $$\sigma_{0}, \sigma_{1}, \dots, \sigma_{5}, \sigma_{\infty} \subset \mathcal{C}.$$

We let $\mathcal{L}$ denote the line bundle
$\O_{\mathcal{C}}(-\sigma_{\infty})|_{\sigma_{\infty}} \simeq
\omega_{\varphi}|_{\sigma_{\infty}}$ -- we view it as a line bundle on
$\overline{\M}_{0,7}$, as is customary.  Following standard notation,
we set $\psi_{\infty} := c_{1}\mathcal{L}$.  The sole enumerative
result about $\overline{\M}_{0,7}$ we will use in this section is:

\begin{theorem}[ ???2 ]
  \label{theorem:psi}
  $$\int_{\overline{\M}_{0,7}} \psi_{\infty}^{4} = 1.$$
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Construction of the family}
\label{sec:construction-familyB2}


We move on to the construction of our good family over $B_2$. Start
with the rank $2$ vector bundle
$$\mathcal{A} := \varphi_{*}\O_{\mathcal{C}}(\sigma_{\infty})$$ on
$\overline{\M}_{0,7}$.  From the fact that the line bundle
$\O_{\mathcal{C}}(\sigma_{\infty})$ restricts to $\mathcal{L}^{-1}$ on
$\sigma_{\infty}$ and $\O_{\sigma_{0}}$ on $\sigma_{0}$, it follows
that
\begin{align*}
  \mathcal{A} \simeq \O_{\overline{\M}_{0,7}} \oplus \mathcal{L}^{-1}.
\end{align*}

Next, put $\o{\mathcal{C}} := \P \mathcal{A}^{\smvee}$;
$\overline{\mathcal{C}}$ is a $\P^{1}$-bundle over
$\overline{\M}_{0,7}$ with structural map
$$\o{\varphi}: \o{\cC} \to \o{\M}_{0,7}$$ and the surjection
$\varphi^{*}\mathcal{A} \to \O_{\mathcal{C}}(\sigma_{\infty})$ induces
a {\sl contraction map}

\begin{align}
  \label{eq:contract}
  \gamma: \mathcal{C} \to \overline{\mathcal{C}}.
\end{align}

The effect of $\gamma$ on a stable curve $(C, s_0, \dots, s_{\infty})$
is to contract all irreducible components not containing the marked
point $s_{\infty}$, leaving the unique $\P^{1}$ containing the marked
point $s_{\infty}$.  This remaining $\P^{1}$ is the corresponding
fiber of the $\P^{1}$-bundle $\overline{\mathcal{C}}$.

Under $\gamma$, the sections $\sigma_{i}$ map to sections, which we
denote by $\overline{\sigma_{i}}$, of $\o{\varphi}$.  These sections
have the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\overline{\sigma}_{\infty}$ is disjoint from all other sections, and
\item in each fiber of $\o{\varphi}$, the union of all seven sections
  is supported on at least three points.
\end{itemize}




The next step is to invoke the relative $2$-veronese embedding
$$\iota: \overline{\mathcal{C}} \hookrightarrow \cP:= \P \Sym^{2}\mathcal{A}^{\smvee}.$$
We let $\rho: \cP \to \o{\M}_{0,7}$ denote the structural map of this
$\P^{2}$-bundle.  In this way, $\overline{\mathcal{C}} \subset \cP$ is
a family of smooth conics with $7$ marked points
$\overline{\sigma}_{0}, \dots, \overline{\sigma}_{\infty}$ satisfying
the two properties just mentioned above.

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:tau} Let $\tau \subset \cP$ denote the section obtained
  by taking, fiber-by-fiber, the point polar (with respect to the
  conic $\iota(\overline{\mathcal{C}})$) to the line spanned by
  $\overline{\sigma}_{0}$ and $\overline{\sigma}_{\infty}$ in each
  fiber.
\end{definition}

Observe that, since $\o{\sigma}_{0}$ and $\o{\sigma}_{\infty}$ are {\sl
    disjoint}, it follows that the three sections
  $\tau, \o{\sigma}_{0},$ and $\o{\sigma}_{\infty}$ are non-collinear
  in every fiber of $\rho: \cP \to \o{\M}_{0,7}$.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lemma:tau}
  The section $\tau \subset \cP$ is induced by an inclusion of the
  form
  $${\mathcal{L}} \hookrightarrow \Sym^{2} \mathcal{A}^{\smvee}.$$
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Let $\mathcal{T} \hookrightarrow \Sym^{2} \mathcal{A}^{\smvee}$
  denote the line sub-bundle corresponding to the section $\tau$ -- we
  must show $\mathcal{T} \simeq \mathcal{L}$.

  The sections
  $\o{\sigma_{0}}$ and $\o{\sigma}_{\infty}$ correspond, respectively,
  to inclusions of the form
  \begin{align*}
    \O \hookrightarrow \Sym^{2} \mathcal{A}^{\smvee}, \\
    \mathcal{L}^{2} \hookrightarrow \Sym^{2} \mathcal{A}^{\smvee}. \\
  \end{align*}

  Since $\tau$, $\o{\sigma}_{0}$, and $\o{\sigma}_{\infty}$ are
  non-collinear in every fiber of $\rho$, we deduce that the induced
  map
  $$\mathcal{T} \oplus \mathcal{L}^{2} \oplus \O \to \Sym^{2}
  \mathcal{A}^{\smvee}$$ is an isomorphism.  Since
  $\Sym^{2} \mathcal{A}^{\smvee} \simeq \O \oplus \mathcal{L} \oplus
  \mathcal{L}^{2}$, the claim now follows by considering determinants.
\end{proof}


\begin{definition}
  \label{def:ZB2} We let $\Sigma \subset \iota(\o{\mathcal{C}})$
  denote the union of the sections
  $\o{\sigma}_{1}, \dots, \o{\sigma}_{5}$.  We let
  $\mathcal{Z} \subset \cP$ denote the (disjoint) union
  $\Sigma \bigsqcup \tau$.
\end{definition}

The reader can immediately check that $\mathcal{Z} \subset \cP$
registers an admissible length $6$ subscheme in each fiber of
$\rho$. In light of this, we let
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:VB2}
  \mathcal{V} := \rho_{*}(\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{Z}} \otimes \omega_{\rho}^{-1});
\end{align}
$\V$ is the natural rank $4$ vector bundle for the family of cubic
surfaces $$\pi: X \to \o{\M}_{0,7}$$ obtained by taking, for each
fiber of $\rho$, the cubic associated to the admissible subscheme
$\mathcal{Z} \subset \cP$.

\begin{proposition}
  \label{prop:goodnessB2} The family $\pi: X \to \o{\M}_{0,7}$ is
  good.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Apply \autoref{prop:good}, after noting that in
  each fiber of $\rho$ the subscheme
  $\Sigma \subset \iota(\o{\mathcal{C}})$ is supported on at least
  three points.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Chern classes of $\V$}
\label{sec:chern-classes-v2}

We must now determing the Chern polynomial of the vector bundle
$\V = \rho_{*}(\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{Z}} \otimes
\omega_{\rho}^{-1})$. In light of the exact sequence
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:exact2}
  0 \to \V \to \rho_{*}\omega_{\rho}^{-1} \to \rho_{*}(\omega_{\rho}^{-1}|_{\mathcal{Z}}) \to 0
\end{align}
it clearly suffices to determine the Chern polynomials of the rank
$10$ bundle $\rho_{*}(\omega_{\rho}^{-1})$ and the rank $6$ bundle
$\rho_{*}(\omega_{\rho}^{-1}|_{\mathcal{Z}})$.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lemma:rank10}
  The bundle $\omega_{\rho}^{-1}$ is isomorphic to
  $\O_{\mathcal{P}}(3) \otimes \rho^{*}\mathcal{L}^{3}$, and
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:rnk10}
    \rho_{*}(\omega_{\rho}^{-1}) \simeq \Sym^{3}(\Sym^{2} \mathcal{A})\otimes \mathcal{L}^{3}.
  \end{align}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  It suffices to prove the first assertion, that
  $\omega_{\rho}^{-1} \simeq \O_{\mathcal{P}}(3) \otimes
  \rho^{*}\mathcal{L}^{3}$.  This follows directly from the relative
  Euler exact sequence for $\rho$:
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:eulerexact}
    0 \to \Omega_{\mathcal{P}/\o{\M}_{0,7}} \to \rho^{*}(\Sym^{2}\mathcal{A}^{\smvee})(-1) \to \O_{\cP} \to 0.
  \end{align}
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
  \label{cor:chern10} The Chern polynomial of
  $\rho_{*}(\omega_{\rho}^{-1})$ is
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:chern10}
    (1-9\psi_{\infty}^{2}t^{2})(1-4\psi_{\infty}^{2}t^{2})(1-\psi_{\infty}^{2}t^{2})^{2}.
  \end{align}
\end{corollary}

\begin{proposition}
  \label{prop:omegarestrictZ} The Chern polynomial of $\rho_{*}(\omega_{\rho}^{-1}|_{\mathcal{Z}})$ is
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:rank6}
    (1+3\psi_{\infty}t) (1+2\psi_{\infty}t) (1+\psi_{\infty}t)  (1-\psi_{\infty}t)
  \end{align}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  First, because $\mathcal{Z}$ is the disjoint union of
  $\Sigma \subset \o{\mathcal{C}}$ and $\tau$, we get a direct sum
  decomposition
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:dirsum}
    \rho_{*}(\omega_{\rho}^{-1}|_{\mathcal{Z}}) = \rho_{*}(\omega_{\rho}^{-1}|_{\Sigma}) \oplus \rho_{*}(\omega_{\rho}^{-1}|_{\tau}).
  \end{align}
  The line bundle $\rho_{*}(\omega_{\rho}^{-1}|_{\tau})$ is easy to
  identify -- in fact it is trivial.  Indeed, \autoref{lemma:tau}
  implies that $\O_{\cP}(1)|_{\tau} \simeq \mathcal{L}^{-1}$, and the
  first claim in \autoref{lemma:rank10} then implies
  $\rho_{*}(\omega_{\rho}^{-1}|_{\tau}) \simeq \mathcal{L}^{-3}
  \otimes \mathcal{L}^{3} = \O_{\o{\M}_{0,7}}$.

  Thus, the Chern polynomial we need is the same as the Chern
  polynomial of $\rho_{*}(\omega_{\rho}^{-1}|_{\Sigma})$ -- we spend
  the rest of the proof extracting it.  Since
  \begin{align*}
    \rho_{*}(\omega_{\rho}^{-1}|_{\Sigma}) = \o{\varphi}_{*}(\iota^{*}\omega_{\rho}^{-1}|_{\Sigma})
  \end{align*}
  we may instead work within the $\P^{1}$-bundle $\o{\cC}$, where
  $\Sigma$ is a divisor.  Since
  $$\iota^{*}\O_{\cP}(1) = \O_{\o{\cC}}(2) = \O_{\o{\cC}}(2\o{\sigma}_{\infty}),$$
  and since $\Sigma$ is disjoint from $\o{\sigma}_{\infty}$, it follows that
  $$\omega_{\rho}^{-1}|_{\Sigma} \simeq \o{\varphi}^{*}(\mathcal{L}^{3})|_{\Sigma},$$ and therefore that
  $$\rho_{*}(\omega_{\rho}^{-1}|_{\Sigma}) \simeq \o{\varphi}_{*}(\o{\varphi}^{*}(\mathcal{L}^{3})|_{\Sigma}) = (\o{\varphi}_{*}\O_{\Sigma})\otimes \mathcal{L}^{3}.$$

  This means we must find the Chern polynomial of
  $\o{\varphi}_{*}\O_{\Sigma}$.  For this, we use a little trick.  In
  the $\P^{1}$-bundle $\o{\cC}$, every section $\o{\sigma}_{i}$ other
  than $\o{\sigma}_{\infty}$ is linearly equivalent to any other such
  section -- we leave it to the reader to deduce this from the
  observation that $\o{\sigma}_{\infty}$ is disjoint from all other
  sections $\o{\sigma}_{i}$.  So, there exists a one-parameter family
  of divisors interpolating between $\Sigma$ and, say, the divisor
  $5\o{\sigma}_{0}$.  Since the Chow ring of $\o{\M}_{0,7}$ is
  finitely generated, it follows that the Chern polynomials of
  $\o{\varphi}_{*}(\O_{\Sigma})$ and
  $\o{\varphi}_{*}(\O_{5 \o{\sigma}_{0}})$ are identical.

  In order to identify the Chern polynomial of
  $\o{\varphi}_{*}(\O_{5 \o{\sigma}_{0}})$, we iteratively use the sequences
  $$0 \to \mathcal{I}_{\o{\sigma}_{0}}^{n-1}/\mathcal{I}_{\o{\sigma}_{0}}^{n} \to \O_{n\o{\sigma}_{0}} \to \O_{(n-1)\o{\sigma}_{0}} \to 0$$ along with the isomorphism of line bundles
  $$\mathcal{I}_{\o{\sigma}_{0}}^{n-1}/\mathcal{I}_{\o{\sigma}_{0}}^{n} \simeq (\mathcal{I}_{\o{\sigma}_{0}}/\mathcal{I}_{\o{\sigma}_{0}}^{2})^{\otimes n-1}$$ to deduce that
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:rk5}
    c(\o{\varphi}_{*}(\O_{5 \o{\sigma}_{0}})) = c(\O_{\o{\M}_{0,7}})c(\mathcal{I}_{\o{\sigma}_{0}}/\mathcal{I}_{\o{\sigma}_{0}}^{2})c((\mathcal{I}_{\o{\sigma}_{0}}/\mathcal{I}_{\o{\sigma}_{0}}^{2})^{2})\cdots c((\mathcal{I}_{\o{\sigma}_{0}}/\mathcal{I}_{\o{\sigma}_{0}}^{2})^{4}).
  \end{align}

  It remains to identify the conormal bundle
  $\mathcal{I}_{\o{\sigma}_{0}}/\mathcal{I}_{\o{\sigma}_{0}}^{2}$ and
  its relationship with the class $\psi_{\infty}$. For this, we leave
  it to the reader to verify: {\sl if a $\P^{1}$-bundle has two
    disjoint sections, then their conormal bundles are inverse to
    each other.}  Therefore,
  $$c(\o{\varphi}_{*}(\O_{5 \o{\sigma}_{0}})) = c(\O)c(\mathcal{L}^{-1})c(\mathcal{L}^{-2})c(\mathcal{L}^{-3})c(\mathcal{L}^{-4}).$$

  The proposition now follows by tracing backwards, starting with this
  latest identity.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
  \label{cor:chernpolyV2} The Chern polynomial of $\V$ is
  $(1-3\psi_{\infty}t)(1-2
  \psi_{\infty}t)(1-\psi_{\infty}^{2}t^{2})$. Therefore,
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:chernV2}
    v_1 = -5\psi_{\infty}\\
    v_2 = 5 \psi_{\infty}^{2}\\ \nonumber
    v_3 = 5 \psi_{\infty}^{3}\\ \nonumber
    v_{4} = -6 \psi_{\infty}^{4}.\\ \nonumber
  \end{align}
\end{corollary}

\subsection{Enumerating cubics in $B_{2}$}

    \caption{Schematic for our second family. We blow up the plane at
      the points $\{s_{1}, \dots, s_{5}, t\}$.}

\end{figure}


Now that we've identified the $v_{i}$, we need only establish
$\deg \mu$, where $\mu: B_{2} \dashrightarrow \M$ is the map to
moduli.  Clearly, $\mu$ factors through
$\mu':B_{2} \dashrightarrow \M^{\dagger}$: $\mu'$ sends a general
$7$-pointed stable curve $(C,s_0,s_1, \dots, s_5, s_{\infty})$ to the
marked cubic surface
$(Bl_{\{s_1, \dots, s_{5}, t\}}\P^{2}, E_1, \dots, E_5, E_t)$. Here,
$C$ is embedded in the plane as a conic, and $E_i$ denotes the
exceptional divisor over the corresponding point.

Clearly, $\deg \mu = 51840 \times \deg \mu'$.  Thus our analysis will
be complete once we show:

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lemma:muprime2} $\deg \mu' = 2.$
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  We need to show that a general marked cubic surface
  $(X, \ell_{1}, \dots, \ell_{6}) \in \M^{\dagger}$ has two preimages
  in $\o{\M_{0,7}}$.
  
  
  Starting with $(X, \ell_{1}, \dots, \ell_{6})$, let
  $(s_1, \dots, s_5, t) \subset \P^{2}$ denote the images of
  $\ell_{i}$ under the map blowing down the six, well defined up to
  $\Aut \P^{2}$.  The five points $s_{i}$ lie on a unique smooth conic
  $C$ on which there is a unique un-ordered pair of points $\{x,y\}$
  whose tangent lines intersect at $t$.  The two stable curves
  $(C,x,s_1, \dots, s_5, y)$ and $(C,y,s_1, \dots, s_5, x)$ are then
  the two claimed preimage points in $\o{\M}_{0,7}$, proving the
  lemma.
\end{proof}


\subsection{Second relation}
\label{sec:secondrelation}

By assembling the information in this section, using
\autoref{theorem:psi} to compute the various monomials in the $v_{i}$,
we find our second relation:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:relation2}
  625 a_{1^{4}} + 125 a_{1^{2}2} - 25a_{13} + 25a_{2^2} - 6 a_{4} = 2 \times 51840.
\end{align}

\section{Family $B_3$}
\label{sec:family-b_3}


\begin{figure}[!]
    \centering
%    \incfig{FigureB3}
    \caption{Third family schematic. The point $\nu(s_{\infty})$ is
      the point at infinity. It, along with
      $\nu(s_{i}), i=1, \dots, 5$ are to be blown up.}
    \label{fig:FigureB3}
\end{figure}


Let us reset notation once again.  Our third family is a variant of
the family in the previous section \autoref{sec:family-b_2}.  It is
parametrized by the base variety
$$B_{3} := \hM_{0,7}.$$

Here, $\hM_{0,7}$ is a particular Hassett space parametrizing
${\bf w}$-stable $7$-pointed genus $0$ curves, where
$${\bf w} = \left(1-\epsilon, \epsilon, \dots, \epsilon, 1-3 \epsilon \right), 0 < \epsilon \ll 1$$
is the weight vector on the marked points
$(s_{0}, s_{1}, \dots, s_{5}, s_{\infty})$ on a genus $0$ curve.

Before getting buried in details, we explain the basic construction of
the family of cubic surfaces over the interior, $\M_{0,7}$.  Begin
with $(C, s_{0}, s_{1}, \dots, s_{5}, s_{\infty})$, a smooth rational
curve with $7$ distinct marked points, and choose a map
$$\nu: C \to \P^{2},$$ birational onto its image
$\nu(C)$, which is a {\sl cuspidal cubic curve with cusp point
  $\nu(s_{0})$ and unique flex point $\nu(s_{\infty})$.}  Let
$Z = \nu(\{s_{1}, \dots, s_{5}, s_{\infty}\}) $, and now assign the
cubic surface $\Bl_{Z}\P^{2}$.  The main objective of this section is
to demonstrate that this assignment extends over the boundary of
$\hM_{0,7}$, yielding a good family of cubic surfaces from which we
can extract one more relation.

Before starting the analysis, we make some remarks: The need for using
the alternate compactification $\hM_{0,7}$ ultimately traces to the
requirement that our family must be good.  There are several possible
variants of the construction, but the reader will eventually realize
that, very often, there will be a few non-good fibers present.


Finally, in the interest of brevity, {\sl we assume the reader is
  familiar with the intersection theory of $\o{\M}_{0,n}$, as
  explained in, for example \cite[??].}  Therefore, we will at time
translate intersection products on $\hM_{0,7}$ into calculations on
$\o{\M}_{0,7}$, and then leave it to the reader to check the results
there.

\subsection{The spaces $\hM_{0,n}$}
\label{sec:spaces-hm_0-n}

In order to carry out the calculations needed for our third relation,
we need to investigate the basic geometry of a series of
Hassett-spaces which we denote by $\hM_{0,n}$.  We do that in this
section.

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:hM0n} For each $n \geq 4$, we define $\hM_{0,n}$ to be
  the compactification of $\M_{0,n}$ by ${\bf w}$-stable, $n$-pointed,
  genus $0$ curves, where
  $${\bf w} = \left(1- \epsilon, \epsilon, \dots, \epsilon, 1-(n-4)\epsilon \right), 0 < \epsilon \ll 1.$$
\end{definition}

We will denote a ${\bf w}$-stable curve by
$(C, s_{0}, s_{1}, \dots, s_{n-2}, s_{\infty})$.  The indices are
meant to indicate that the two points $s_{0}$ and $s_{\infty}$ are two
``more interesting'' points, as will become apparent in the next
paragraph.

The pointed curves $(C, s_{0}, s_{1}, \dots, s_{n-2}, s_{\infty})$
parametrized by $\hM_{0,n}$ are actually very simple to describe:

\begin{itemize}
\item $C$ is a {\sl smooth} rational curve,
\item $s_{0}$ and $s_{\infty}$ must be distinct,
\item at most one of the $s_{i}$, $i=1, \dots, n-2$ can coincide with
  $s_{0}$,
\item at most $n-4$ of the $s_{i}$, $i=1, \dots, n-2$ can coincide
  with $s_{\infty}$.
\item there are no constraints on how the points $s_{i}$,
  $i=1, \dots, n-2$ can coincide with each other.
\end{itemize}
Therefore, the universal curve $$\varphi: \cC \to \hM_{0,n}$$ is in
fact a $\P^{1}$-bundle, the projectivization of a particular rank $2$
vector bundle $\mathcal{W}$ on $\hM_{0,n}$. We let
$\sigma_{i} \subset \cC$,
$i \in \left\{0,1,2, \dots, n-2, \infty\right\}$ denote the universal
sections providing the marked points, and we denote by
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:stab}
  \zeta: \overline{\M}_{0,n} \to \hM_{0,n}
\end{align}
the stabilization morphism.  We will sometimes use $\zeta$ to
pull-back enumerative calculations on $\hM_{0,n}$ back to
$\overline{\M}_{0,n}$, where they are better understood.

\subsubsection{Divisor classes on $\hM_{0,n}$}
\label{sec:divisor-classes-hm_0}

Certain divisors on $\hM_{0,n}$  play an essential role in our
computations, so we take this section to introduce them.

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:psihats} We let $\hL_{0}, \hL_{\infty}$ denote the line
  bundles
  $\omega_{\varphi}|_{\sigma_{0}},
  \omega_{\varphi}|_{\sigma_{\infty}}$, respectively, and let
  $\hpsi_{0}, \hpsi_{\infty} \in A^{1}(\hM_{0,n})$ denote their first
  Chern classes.
\end{definition}

Since the sections $\sigma_{0}$ and $\sigma_{\infty}$ are disjoint, it
follows that
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:opposites}
  \hpsi_{0} + \hpsi_{\infty} = 0.
\end{align}


Finally, we indicate the simple relationship between $\hpsi_{0}$ on
$\hM_{0,n}$ with $\psi_{0}$ on $\o{\M}_{0,n}$.  Let
$\delta_{\{i,0\}}, i=1, \dots, n-2$ denote the boundary divisor in
$\o{\M}_{0,n}$ whose general point corresponds to the union of two
marked $\P^{1}$'s, one of which contains only $0$-th and $i$-th marked
points.



Then,
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:relationpsis}
\zeta^{*}(\hpsi_{0}) = \psi_{0} - \sum_{i \in \{1, \dots, n-2\}} \delta_{\{i,0\}}.  
\end{align}













\begin{definition}
  \label{def:boundary}
  For each distinct pair of indices
  $i,j \in \{0, 1, 2, \dots, n-2, \infty \}$, we define
  $\Delta_{i,j} \subset \hM_{0,n}$ to be the divisor over which the
  sections $\sigma_{i}$ and $\sigma_{j}$ intersect, and we set
  $$\Delta_{\infty} = \sum_{i \in \{1, \dots, n-2 \}}
  \Delta_{i,\infty}.$$
\end{definition}

The specific boundary divisors $\Delta_{i, \infty}$, where the section
$\sigma_{i}$ collides with $\sigma_{\infty}$ will play an especially
important role in our calculations will be important for us, so we
briefly collect some observations about them:
\begin{itemize}\label{item:boundaryprops}
\item Each boundary divisor $\Delta_{i,\infty} \subset \hM_{0,n}$ is
  naturally isomorphic to $\hM_{0,n-1}$ via a map
  $$\eta_{i}: \hM_{0,n-1} \to \hM_{0,n}$$ that sends
  $(C, s_{0}, \dots, s_{n-3}, s_{\infty})$ to
  $(C, s_{0}, \dots, s_{i-1}, s_{i}=s_{\infty}, s_{i+1} \dots,
  s_{\infty})$.

  In the same way, if $i \neq j$, then the intersection
  $\Delta_{i,\infty} \cap \Delta_{j, \infty}$ is isomorphic to
  $\hM_{0,n-2}$ via a similarly defined map
  $$\eta_{i,j}: \hM_{0,n-2} \to \hM_{0,n},$$ and so on.  This provides a
  nice inductive structure among the Hassett spaces $\hM_{0,n}$.
  
\item Under $\eta$, we clearly have $\eta^{*}\hpsi_{0} = \hpsi_{0}$
  and $\eta^{*}\hpsi_{\infty} = \hpsi_{\infty}.$
\item We have:
\begin{align}\label{eq:pullbackdelta}
  \eta^{*}([\Delta_{i,\infty}]) = -\hpsi_{\infty} \in A^{1}(\hM_{0,n-1}).
\end{align}
To see this, first note that
$\Delta_{i, \infty} = \varphi_{*}(\sigma_{i}\sigma_{\infty})$, and so
$\eta^{*}([\Delta_{i,\infty}]) = \varphi_{*}(\sigma_{\infty}^{2})$,
where the latter equation is happening in the divisor class group of
$\hM_{0,n-1}$.  But
$\varphi_{*}(\sigma_{\infty}^{2}) = - \hpsi_{\infty}$, and the claim
follows.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Computing integrals in $\hM_{0,n}$}

These observations are enough to compute, using an inductive method,
any top degree integral involving $\hpsi_{0}, \hpsi_{\infty},$ and the
boundary divisors $\Delta_{i, \infty}$.

\begin{example}
  \label{ex:toppsi}
  Let's first indicate how to
  compute $$\int_{\hM_{0,n}}\hpsi_{0}^{n-3}.$$ Using
  \eqref{eq:relationpsis}, this amounts to computing
  $$\int_{\o{\M}_{0,n}} \left(\psi_{0} - \sum_{i \in \{1, \dots, n-2\}} \delta_{\{i,0\}}\right)^{n-3}.$$
  Now, in the Chow ring of $\o{\M}_{0,n}$, recall that:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $\psi_{0} \cdot \delta_{\{i,0\}} = 0$, 
  \item $\delta_{\{i,0\}} \cdot \delta_{\{j,0\}} = 0$ for $i \neq j$,
    and
  \item $\int_{\o{\M}_{0,n}}\delta_{\{i,0\}}^{n-3} = (-1)^{n}$, for
    all $i$, and
  \item $\int_{\o{\M}_{0,n}} \psi_{0}^{n-3} = 1$.
  \end{itemize}

  Using these, we deduce:
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:hpsitop}
    \int_{\hM_{0,n}}\hpsi_{0}^{n-3} = -(n-3). 
  \end{align}
\end{example}

Next, we do an example involving $\Delta_{i, \infty}$'s.

\begin{example}
  Consider
  $$\int_{\hM_{0,7}} \Delta_{i, \infty}^{2}\Delta_{j, \infty}^{2},$$
  where $i \neq j$.  Using the parametrization
  $\eta_{i,j} : \hM_{0,5} \to \Delta_{i,\infty} \cap
  \Delta_{j,\infty}$, we see that this integral is the same as
  $$\int_{\hM_{0,5}}\eta_{i,j}^{*}[\Delta_{i, \infty}] \cdot \eta_{i,j}^{*}[\Delta_{j, \infty}],$$
  which in turn is equal to
  $$\int_{\hM_{0,5}}(-\hpsi_{\infty})^{2} = \int_{\hM_{0,5}}\hpsi_{0}^{2} = -2,$$
  as seen by combining \eqref{eq:hpsitop} with previous observations
  on how boundary divisors pull back along $\eta_{i}$ maps.
\end{example}

\subsection{Construction of the family over $\hM_{0,7}$}
\label{sec:constr-family-hM07}

Let us proceed to the formal construction of our family, starting with
the universal curve
$$\varphi: \cC \to \hM_{0,7}.$$
The idea is to map $\cC$ to a relative cuspidal cubic curve in a
$\P^{2}$-bundle so that $\sigma_{0}$ becomes the cusp point and
$\sigma_{\infty}$ becomes the flex point.


Consider the rank $2$
vector bundle $\mathcal{A} = \varphi_{*}\O_{\cC}(\sigma_{\infty})$ --
since $\sigma_{\infty}$ and $\sigma_{0}$ are disjoint, and since
$\O_{\cC}(\sigma_{\infty})|_{\sigma_{\infty}} = \hL_{\infty}^{-1}$ and
$\O_{\cC}(\sigma_{0})|_{\sigma_{0}} \simeq \O_{\hM_{0,7}}$, it follows
that
$$\mathcal{A} \simeq \O_{\hM_{0,7}} \oplus \hL_{\infty}^{-1}.$$
We emphasize that the above direct sum decomposition is induced by
applying $\varphi_{*}$ to the restriction map
$\O_{\cC}(\sigma_{\infty}) \to \O_{\cC}(\sigma_{\infty})|_{\sigma_{0}
  \cup \sigma_{\infty}}.$

  Next, consider the subbundle
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:S}
    \mathcal{S} = :\O_{\hM_{0,7}} \oplus \hL_{\infty}^{-2} \oplus \hL_{\infty}^{-3} \subset \Sym^{3} \mathcal{A} = \O_{\hM_{0,7}} \oplus \hL_{\infty}^{-1} \oplus \hL_{\infty}^{-2} \oplus \hL_{\infty}^{-3},
  \end{align}
  and denote by
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:nu}
    \nu: \cC \to \P \mathcal{S}^{\smvee}
  \end{align}
  the $\hM_{0,7}$-morphism induced by the surjection
  $\varphi^{*}\mathcal{S} \to \O_{\cC}(3\sigma_{\infty})$. Denote by
  $\rho: \P \mathcal{S}^{\smvee} \to \hM_{0,7}$ the $\P^{2}$-bundle
  structural map.  Fiber-by-fiber, the effect of $\nu$ is to map the
  fibers of $\cC$ to a cuspidal cubic curve, with $\nu(\sigma_{0})$
  the cusp point and $\nu(\sigma_{\infty})$ the flex point.

  We denote by $\mathcal{Z} \subset \cC$ the union of the six sections
  $\sigma_{1}, \dots, \sigma_{\infty}$.  Because at most one of the
  sections $\sigma_{i}, i \in \{1, \dots, \infty\}$ is allowed to
  intersect $\sigma_{0}$ (which becomes the cusp under $\nu$), it
  follows that $\nu|_{\mathcal{Z}}:\mathcal{Z} \to \nu(\mathcal{Z})$
  is an isomorphism. As will be demonstrated in
  \autoref{sec:goodness3}, every member of the family of length $6$
  subschemes $\nu(\mathcal{Z}) \subset \P \mathcal{S}^{\smvee}$ is
  admissible, and has a {\sl good} associated cubic surface.
  Therefore, our attention is brought upon the natural rank $4$ bundle
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:V3}
    \V := \rho_{*}\left(\omega_{\rho}^{-1} \otimes \mathcal{I}_{\nu(\mathcal{Z})}\right)
  \end{align}
  of our claimed good family $$\pi: X \to \hM_{0,7},$$ with
  $X := \Bl_{\nu(\mathcal{Z})}\P \mathcal{S}^{\smvee}$.


\subsection{Goodness}
\label{sec:goodness3}

\begin{proposition}
  \label{prop:goodcusp}
  Let $C \subset \P^{2}$ be a cuspidal cubic, and let
  $s_{i} \in C, i \in \{1, \dots, 5, \infty \}$ be six, not
  necessarily distinct, points satisfying:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item At most one $s_{i}$ is the cusp point,
  \item $s_{\infty}$ is the flex point of $C$, and
  \item at most three $s_{i}, i \leq 5$ are equal to $s_{\infty}$.
  \end{enumerate}
  Then the length $6$ subscheme $Z := \sum_{i}s_{i}$, interpreted as a
  divisor on $C$, is admissible and $\Aut(\P^{2},Z)$ is finite. NOT TRUE!!!?
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  
\end{proof}

  

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------



\section{Family $B_4$}




\label{sec:family-b_4}

We construct our third family $B_3$ be starting with a quintic del
Pezzo surface $S$, which is the blow up of the plane at four general
points, and then ``blowing up all pairs of points on $S$.''

The surface $S$ has $10$ exceptional lines $L_{1}, \dots, L_{10}$.  We
let $S^{[2]}$ denote the Hilbert scheme of pairs of points on $S$.
$S^{[2]}$ contains $10$ disjoint $\P^{2}$'s,
$\Lambda_1, \dots, \Lambda_{10}$, namely the Hilbert schemes of pairs
of points contained in the lines $L_{i}$. Let
$\Lambda = \cup_{i}\Lambda_{i}$.

\subsection{Construction of $B_4$}
\label{sec:construction-b_4}

Let $Z \subset S^{[2]} \times S$ denote the universal degree two
subscheme; $Z$ is smooth and the first projection
$\pi_1 : Z \to S^{[2]}$ is finite, flat, and has degree two.



First, observe that the open set
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:UB3}
  U := S^{[2]} \setminus \Lambda
\end{align}
supports a good family of cubic surfaces, namely
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:XUB3}
  X^{\circ} := \Bl_{Z}(S^{[2]} \times S).
\end{align}

(We encourage the reader to check that $X^{\circ}/U$ is indeed good.)

However, when we extend $X^{\circ}$ in the natural way over $S^{[2]}$
the family acquires bad fibers, namely unions of quadrics and planes,
and therefore we must modify $S^{[2]}$ along $\Lambda$.

Let
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:S2tilde}
  \widetilde{S^{[2]}} := \Bl_{\Lambda}S^{[2]}
\end{align}
denote the blow-up with blow-down map
$\beta: \widetilde{S^{[2]}} \to S^{[2]}$.  Let
$E_{i} = \beta^{-1}(\Lambda_{i})$, $i=1, \dots, 10$ denote the
components of the of the exceptional divisor of the blow-up; $\beta$
expresses $E_{i}$ as a $\P^{1}$-bundle over $\Lambda_{i}$.

Next, let $\widetilde{Z} := \widetilde{S^{[2]}} \times_{S^{[2]}} Z$
denote the fiber-product; $\widetilde{Z}$ is a closed subscheme of the
product $\widetilde{S^{[2]}} \times S$, and is a finite, flat, degree
two cover of $\widetilde{S^{[2]}}$ under the first projection
$\tilde{\pi}_{1} : \widetilde{Z} \to \widetilde{S^{[2]}}.$

Inside the product $\widetilde{S^{[2]}} \times S$ we define the
smooth, closed subschemes
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:Fi}
  F_{i} := E_{i} \times L_{i};
\end{align}
we let $F := \cup_{i}F_{i}$.  We perform one more blow-up to get 
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:Xtilde}
  Y := \Bl_{F}\widetilde{S^{[2]}} \times S.
\end{align}
The natural projection $ Y \to \widetilde{S^{[2]}}$ is a family of
surfaces with simple normal crossing singular fibers over $E_{i}$.
The next lemma is critical.

\begin{lemma}
  The closed immersion
  $\widetilde{Z} \subset \widetilde{S^{[2]}} \times S$ lifts to a
  closed immersion $\widetilde{Z} \subset Y$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  The main observation is that we have an equality of schemes
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:Cartier}
    F_i \cap \widetilde{Z} = \widetilde{\pi}_{1}^{-1}(E_i) \cap \widetilde{Z}
  \end{align}
  for all $i=1, \dots, 10$, {\sl and therefore $F \cap \widetilde{Z}$
    is a Cartier divisor on $\widetilde{Z}$}. The claim now follows
  from a basic property of blow-ups.
\end{proof}



We are close to describing a family of cubic surfaces over
$\widetilde{S^{[2]}}$.  We first let
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:XB3}
  Y' := \Bl_{\widetilde{Z}}Y
\end{align}
denote the blow-up,
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:phiB3}
  \varphi: Y' \to Y
\end{align}
the blow-down map, and
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:piB3}
  \pi: Y' \to \widetilde{S^{[2]}}
\end{align}
the natural projection. Finally, let $F' \subset Y'$ denote the
exceptional divisor $\varphi^{-1}(F)$.
\begin{proposition}
  \label{proposition:resolv-b3}
  There exists a line bundle $\mathcal{L}$ on $Y'$ which induces a
  rational map
  \begin{align*}
    \rho: Y' \dashrightarrow \P(\pi_{*}\mathcal{L})
  \end{align*}
  whose image $X \subset \P(\pi_{*}\mathcal{L})$ is a good family of
  cubic surfaces over $\widetilde{S^{[2]}}$ with natural bundle
  $V = \pi_{*} \mathcal{L}$.
\end{proposition}

(By image, we mean ``closure of image''.)

(This one I still am confident in -- one simple blow-up resolves the situation.)


\subsection{Relation $B_4$}
\label{sec:relation-b_4}

The relation we get from family $B_3$ ultimately appears to be:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:relationB4}
  6a_{1^{4}} + 21a_{1^{2}2}+6a_{13}+16a_{2^{2}}+a_{4} = 36 \times 6! = 25920.
\end{align}

(There is an 80 percent chance I made a mistake in the long
calculation, so be careful.)

\section{Isotrivial families}
In this section, we exhibit a number of good isotrivial families.  All
of these families will arise from a cubic surface $X$ with
automorphism group $\G_m$.  To make sure that these families
are good, we must prove that $X$ does not lie in the closure of the
orbit of a generic cubic surface.  If $X$ is a semi-stable point of
the $\SL_4$ action on the space of cubics $\P^{19}$, then this follows
from GIT.  We now explain an extension of this idea that allows for
even more examples.

Let $V$ be a 4-dimensional vector space.  Consider the natural action
of $\SL(V)$ on $\P(\Sym^3V) \times \P V$ (here $\P$ denotes the space
of one-dimensional subspaces).  That is, consider the action of
$\SL_4$ on the set of pairs $(X, H)$, where $X \subset \P^3$ is a
cubic surface and $H \subset \P^3$ is a hyperplane.  For a pair of
positive integers $a, b$, the action lifts uniquely to an action on
the ample line bundle $\mathcal O(a)\boxtimes \mathcal O(b)$; the GIT
of the resulting linearized action depends only on the ratio
$t = a/b$.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:nolimit}
  Let $t$ be a positive rational number.
  Suppose $S \subset \P^3$ is a cubic surface such that for every hyperplane $H$, the pair $(S,H)$ is $t$-stable.
  Let $X \subset \P^3$ be a cubic surface whose stabilizer group $T \subset \PGL(4)$ is reductive.
  Let $T_0 \circ T$ be the connected component of the identity, and assume that there exists a $T_0$-fixed hyperplane $H \subset \P^3$ such that the pair $(X, H)$ is $t$-semistable.
  Then $X$ does not lie in the closure of the $\PGL_4$-orbit of $S$.
\end{proposition}

For the proof, we need a lemma.
\begin{lemma}\label{prop:oneparam}
  Let \(U\) be a smooth scheme over $\k$ with an action of a linear algebraic group $G$.
  Let $x \in U(\k)$ be a point whose stabilizer group $T \subset G$ is reductive.
  If $x$ lies in the closure of the $G$-orbit of a point $s \in U(\k)$, then there exists a one-parameter subgroup $\lambda \colon \G_m \to T$ and a point $s'$ in the $G$-orbit of $s$ such that
  \[ x = \lim_{t \to 0} \lambda(t) \cdot s'.\]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  This is a consequence of the Hilbert--Mumford criterion and the \'etale local structure of algebraic stacks near a point with a reductive stabilizer (see \cite[\S~1.3 Immediate consequences (5)]{alp.hal.ryd:20}).
  For the convenience of the reader, we include the details.
  By \cite[Theorem~3]{alp:10}, there exists a $T$-invariant locally closed affine $W \subset U$ containing the point $x$ such that the map
  \[ \pi \colon [W/T] \to [U / G]\]
  is affine and \'etale.
  (Note that this result is substantially easier than the main theorem of \cite{alp.hal.ryd:20}.)
  Define $Z$ as the fiber product
  \[
    \begin{tikzcd}
      Z \ar{r}\ar{d}& {[W/T]}\ar{d}{\pi}\\
      \spec \k \ar{r}{[S]}& {[U/G]}.
    \end{tikzcd}
  \]
  Since $\pi$ is representable, \'etale, and of finite type, $Z$ is a finite disjoint of copies of $\spec \k$.
  Let $z_1, \dots, z_n \in [W/T](\k)$ be the points so that $Z = \sqcup s_i$.
  Since the point $x \in [U/G](\k)$ lies in the closure of $s \in [U/G](\k)$ and the map $\pi$ is \'etale (and hence open), the point $x \in [W/T](\k)$ lies in the closure of the set $\{z_1,\dots, z_n\}$.
  But then $x$ lies in the closure of $z_i$ for some $i$.
  In other words, the point $x \in W(\k)$ lies in the closure of the $T$-orbit of a lift $s_i \in W(\k)$ of $z_i \in [W/T](\k)$.
  By the Hilbert--Mumford criterion \cite[Theorem~1.4]{kem:78}, there exists a one-parameter subgroup $\lambda \colon \G_m \to T$ such that we have the equation
  \begin{equation}\label{eqn:specialization}
    x = \lim_{t \to 0} \lambda (t) \cdot s_i
  \end{equation}
  in $W(\k)$.
  Since $s_i \in [W/T](\k)$ maps to $s \in [U/G](\k)$, the image $s' \in U(\k)$ of $s_i \in W(\k)$ is in the same $G$-orbit of $s$.
  Mapping both sides of equation~\eqref{eqn:specialization} to $U(\k)$ yields the claim.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of \autoref{prop:nolimit}]
  Suppose $X$ lies in the orbit closure of $S$.
  We prove that for any $T_0$-stable hyperplane $H$, the pair $(X, H)$ must be $t$-unstable.
  By applying \autoref{prop:oneparam} to $U = \P \Sym^3V$ and $G = \PGL V$, we deduce that there exists a one-parameter subgroup $\lambda \colon \G_m \to T_0$ and a cubic surface $S' \subset \P^3$ such that $S'$ is in the $\PGL_4$-orbit of $S$ and
  \[ X = \lim_{t \to 0} \lambda_t \cdot S'.\]
  Consider any $\lambda$-fixed hyperplane $H \subset \P^3$.
  We have
  \[ \lim_{t \to 0} \lambda_t(S', H) = (X, H).\]
  Since $(S', H)$ is $t$-stable, the limit $(X, H)$ must be $t$-unstable.
  The proof is then complete.
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}\label{cor:nolimit}
  Let $X$ be as in \autoref{prop:nolimit} and assume $0 < t \leq 3/7$.
  Let $S$ be a smooth cubic surface without an Eckardt point.
  Then $X$ is not in the closure of the $\PGL_4$ orbit of $S$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  We use the classification of $t$-stable pairs $(S,H)$ due to Gallardo and Martinez-Garcia \cite{gal.mar:19}.
  For a smooth cubic surface $S$ without an Eckardt point and any hyperplane $H$, the curve $D = S \cap H$ is reduced and has $A_n$ singularities for $n \leq 3$ (at worst tacnodes).
  From \cite[Theorem~2]{gal.mar:19}, it follows that $(S, H)$ is $t$-stable.
  We now use \autoref{prop:nolimit}.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
  The following surfaces are not in the closure of the $\PGL_4$-orbit of a generic cubic surface (the parenthesis describes the singularities):
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $x_0x_1x_3 = x_2^3$ \quad $(3A_2)$
  \item $x_3(x_0x_2-x_1^2) = x_0x_1^2$ \quad $(A_3 + 2A_1)$
  \item $x_3(x_0x_2-x_1^2) = x_0^2x_1$ \quad $(A_4 + A_1)$
  \item $x_3x_0^2 = x_1^3 + x_2^3$ \quad $(D_4)$
  \end{enumerate}
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  Each surface $X$ in this list has a reductive stabilizer group $T$, and there exists a $T_0$-fixed hyperplane section $H$ such that the pair $(X, H)$ is $t$-semistable for some $0 < t \leq 3/7$.
  We now apply \autoref{cor:nolimit}.

  In the following table, we list the automorphism groups, the hyperplane $H$, and the relevant value of $t$.
  The automorphism groups are from \cite[Theorem~3]{sak:10} and the data of the $t$-semistable hyperplane is from \cite[Table~2]{gal.mar:19}.
  We denote the symmetric group on $n$ letters by $\Sigma_n$.
  \begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{l l l l}
    \toprule
    $X$ & $\Aut(X)$ & $H$ & $t$\\
    \midrule
    $x_0x_1x_3 = x_2^3$& $\G_m^2 \rtimes \Sigma_3$ & $x_2 = 0$ & All $0 < t < 1$\\
    $x_3(x_0x_2-x_1^2) = x_0x_1^2$& $\G_m \rtimes \Sigma_2$ & $x_2 = 0$ & $1/5$ \\
    $x_3(x_0x_2-x_1^2) = x_0^2x_1$& $\G_m$ & $x_2 = 0$ & $1/3$\\
    $x_3x_0^2 = x_1^3 + x_2^3$& $\G_m \rtimes \Sigma_3$ & $x_3 = 0$ & $3/7$\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{proof}

Let $X$ be a good cubic surface (not in the closure of a general orbit) with stabilizer group $\G_m$.
We have a good family
\[ \mathcal X = [X / \G_m] \xrightarrow{\pi} [. / \G_m] = B\G_m,\]
yielding a moduli map
\[\mu \colon B \G_m \to [\P^{19}/\SL_4].\]
By construction, the pull-back under $\mu$ of the closure of a generic orbit is empty.
Therefore, we must have
\[ a_{1^4} v_1^4 + a_{1^22}v_1^2v_2 + a_{13}v_1v_3 + a_{2^2}v_2^2 + a_4v_4 = 0.\]
By computing $v_1^4, \dots, v_4$, we get a linear relationship among the coefficients.

To compute $v_1^4, \dotso, v_4$, we must identify the vector bundle $\pi_* \left( \omega_{\mathcal X/B\G_m}^{-1}\right)$.
To do so, let $\mathcal V$ be the rank 4 vector bundle on $B \G_m$ corresponding to the representation $\G_m \to \SL_4$.
Then $\mathcal X \subset \P \mathcal V$ is a divisor, given by a global section of a line bundle
\[ \mathcal L = \mathcal O_{\P \mathcal V}(3) \otimes \pi^* M\]
for some line bundle $M$ on $B\G_m$.
By adjunction, we have
\begin{align*}
  \omega_{\mathcal X/B\G_m} &= \omega_{\P \mathcal V / \G_m} \otimes \mathcal L \big|_{\mathcal X}\\
                                   &= \mathcal O_{\P \mathcal V}(-4) \otimes \mathcal O_{\P \mathcal V}(3) \otimes \pi^* M \big|_{\mathcal X} \\
                                   &= \mathcal O_{\P \mathcal V}(-1) \otimes \pi^* M \big |_{\mathcal X},
\end{align*}
and hence
\begin{align*}
  \pi_* \left( \omega_{\mathcal X/B\G_m}  \right) &= \pi_* \left( \mathcal O_{\P \mathcal V}(1) \big|_{\mathcal X} \right) \otimes M^\vee \\
  &= \mathcal V \otimes M^\vee.
\end{align*}
Hence, by identifying $\mathcal V$ and $M$, we can easily compute the chern classes $v_i$.

Given $a \in \mathbb Z$, we denote by $\chi(a)$ the line bundle on $B\G_m$ corresponding to the character $t \mapsto t^a$.
Denote by $q \in A^1(B\G_m)$ the generator of the cohomology ring given by $q = c_1(\chi(1))$.
\subsection{The family $3A_2$}
For
\[ X: x_0x_1x_3 = x_2^3\]
a stabilizing $\G_m \subset \SL_4$ is given by the diagonal matrix with exponents $(a,b,0,c)$ where $a+b+c = 0$.
Thus, we have
\[\mathcal V = \chi(a) \oplus \chi(b) \oplus \chi(0) \oplus \chi(c).\]
The element $x_0x_1x_3 - x_2^3$ is a global section of $\Sym^3 \mathcal V$.
In other words, $\mathcal X$ is a section of $\mathcal O_{\P \mathcal V}(3)$ and hence we have
\[ M = \chi(0).\]
We get
\[ v_1 = 0, \quad v_2 = (ab+bc+ca) \cdot q^2, \quad v_3 = abc \cdot q^3, \quad v_4 = 0,\]
and hence
\[ v_1^4 = 0, \quad v_1^2v_2 = 0, \quad v_1v_3 = 0,\quad v_2^2 \neq 0, \quad v_4 = 0.\]
Therefore, this family gives the relation
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:iso1}
  a_{2^2} = 0.
\end{equation}

\subsection{The family $A_3 + 2A_1$}
For
\[ X: x_3(x_0x_2-x_1^2) = x_0x_1^2,\]
the stabilizing $\G_m \subset \SL_4$ is given by the diagonal matrix with exponents $(-3,1,5,-3)$.
Thus, we have
\[ \mathcal V = \chi(-3) \oplus \chi(1) \oplus \chi(5) \oplus \chi(-3).\]
The element $x_3(x_0x_2-x_1^2) - x_0x_1^2$ defines a global section of $\Sym^3 \mathcal V \otimes \chi(1)$.
In other words, we have
\[ M = \chi(1).\]
%((-4 -16 64 0) (256 -256 -256 256 0))
We get
\[ v_1 = -4q, \quad v_2 = -16q^2, \quad v_3 = 64q^3, \quad v_4 = 0,\]
and hence
\[ v_1^4 = 256 \quad v_1^2v_2 = -256, \quad v_1v_3 = -256, \quad v_2^2 = 256, \quad v_4 = 0.\]
Therefore, this family gives the relation
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:iso2}
  a_{1^4} - a_{1^2 2}- a_{13} +  a_{2^2}  = 0.
\end{equation}

\subsection{The family $A_4 + A_1$}
For
\[ X: x_3(x_0x_2-x_1^2) = x_0^2x_1,\]
the stabilizing $\G_m \subset \SL_4$ is given by the diagonal matrix with exponents $(1,-1,-3,3)$.
Thus, we have
\[ \mathcal V = \chi(1) \oplus \chi(-1) \oplus \chi(-3) \oplus \chi(3).\]
The element $x_3(x_0x_2-x_1^2) - x^2_0x_1$ defines a global section of $\Sym^3 \mathcal V \otimes \chi(-1)$.
In other words, we have
\[ M = \chi(-1).\]
We get
\[ v_1 = 4q, \quad v_2 = -4q^2, \quad v_3 = -16q^3, \quad v_4 = 0,\]
and hence
\[ v_1^4 = 256 \quad v_1^2v_2 = -64, \quad v_1v_3 = -64, \quad v_2^2 = 16, \quad v_4 = 0.\]
Therefore, this family gives the relation
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:iso3}
  16a_{1^4} -4a_{1^2 2}- 4a_{13} + 1 a_{2^2}  = 0.
\end{equation}

\subsection{The family $D_4$}
For
\[ X: x_3x_0^2 = x_1^3+x_2^3,\]
the stabilizing $\G_m \subset \SL_4$ is given by the diagonal matrix with exponents $(5,1,1,-7)$.
Thus, we have
\[ \mathcal V = \chi(5) \oplus \chi(1) \oplus \chi(1) \oplus \chi(-7).\]
The element $x_3x_0^2-x_1^3-x_2^3$ defines a global section of $\Sym^3 \mathcal V \otimes \chi(-3)$.
In other words, we have
\[ M = \chi(-3).\]
We get
\[ v_1 = -12q, \quad v_2 = -16q^2, \quad v_3 = 192q^3, \quad v_4 = -512q^4,\]
and hence
\[ v_1^4 = 20736 \quad v_1^2v_2 = 2304, \quad v_1v_3 = -2304, \quad v_2^2 = 256, \quad v_4 = -512.\]
Therefore, this family gives the relation
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:iso4}
  81a_{1^4} +9a_{1^2 2}- 9a_{13} +  a_{2^2}-2a_4  = 0.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Families over a base variety}
By choosing a suitable base $B$ and a map $B \to B \G_m$, we
can construct an isotrivial family over $B$ by pulling back one of the
families above.  We describe this explicitly in an example.

Let $B = \P^4$.  Set
\[V = \mathcal O(5) \oplus \mathcal O(1) \oplus \mathcal O(1) \oplus
  \mathcal O(-7).\] Let $x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3$ be generators of the four
summands on the standard $\A^4 \subset \P^4$.  We have
the section $(x_3x_0^2-x_1^3-x_2^3)$ of
$\Sym^3 V = \mathcal O(3)^{\oplus 20}$.  Note that this section has a
pole of order $3$ along the hyperplane at infinity.  As a result, it
defines a section $\xi$ of $\Sym^3 V \otimes \mathcal O(-3)$, which is
nowhere vanishing.  Equivalently, $\xi$ is a section of
$\mathcal O_{\P V}(3) \otimes \pi^* \mathcal O(-3)$.  Our family
$\mathcal X \to B$ is defined by the zero-locus of $\xi$ in
$\P V \to B$.

\appendix

\section{Existance of a universal formula}

In this section, we recall statements from equivariant intersection
theory that guarantee the existence of the formula \eqref{eq:P}. On
this first pass, we will let $\mathbb{P}(V)$ denote the projective
bundle of 1-dimensional subspaces in the fibers of $V$ and correct for
the sign later if people want to work with duals.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:Q_Zclass}
Let $W$ be an $r+1$-dimensional vector space and $Z\subset \operatorname{Sym}^d W^{\vee}$ be a subvariety. Then, the equivariant class $[\mathbb{P}Z]$ inside the equivariant Chow ring 
\begin{align}
    A^{\bullet}(\mathbb{P}_{GL_{r+1}}(\operatorname{Sym}^d W^{\vee}))\cong \frac{\mathbb{Z}[H, t_0,\ldots,t_{r}]^{S^{r+1}}}{\left(\displaystyle\prod_{\substack{i_0+\cdots+i_{r}=d\\ i_0,\ldots,i_r\geq 0}}(H-i_0 t_0 - \cdots - i_r t_r)\right)}\label{eq:equivariantSym}
\end{align}
can be expressed as
\begin{align*}
    Q_Z(t_0-\frac{H}{d},\ldots,t_{r}-\frac{H}{d}),
\end{align*}
for polynomial homogeneous $Q_Z$ with degree equal to the codimension of $Z$. 
\end{lemma}

The variables $t_i$'s in \autoref{lem:Q_Zclass} can either be viewed as chern roots or via the inclusion into the torus-equivariant Chow ring 
\begin{align*}
    A^{\bullet}(\mathbb{P}_{T}(\operatorname{Sym}^d W^{\vee}))\cong \frac{\mathbb{Z}[H, t_0,\ldots,t_{r}]}{\left(\displaystyle\prod_{\substack{i_0+\cdots+i_{r}=d\\ i_0,\ldots,i_r\geq 0}}(H-i_0 t_0 - \cdots - i_r t_r)\right)}
\end{align*}
where $T\subset GL_{r+1}$ is the standard torus.

\begin{proof}[Proof of \autoref{lem:Q_Zclass}]
The formula for the Chow ring of $A^{\bullet}(\mathbb{P}_{GL_{r+1}}(\operatorname{Sym}^d W^{\vee}))$ in \eqref{eq:equivariantSym} follows from the Chow ring of a projective bundle. %applied to the construction of an equivariant Chow ring, didn't find a quick reference for this than other people saying its obvious

The formula for $[\mathbb{P}Z]$ in terms of a polynomial $Q_Z$ follows from \cite[Theorem 6.1]{FNR05}, where $Q_Z$ is the formula for the class of $[Z]$ in $A^{\bullet}_{GL_r+1}(\operatorname{Sym}^d W^{\vee})\cong \mathbb{Z}[H, t_0,\ldots,t_{r}]$. 
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
In the context of \autoref{def:goodfamily} a universal polynomial $P$ as in \eqref{eq:P} exists.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Following the setup in \eqref{eq:P}, we start with a good family $\pi: X\to B$ and let $V=\pi_{*}\omega_{X/B}^{-1}$. Since each fiber of $X\to B$ is embedded into $\mathbb{P}(V)$ as a cubic surface via the anticanonical map, we get a section $\sigma$ of the bundle $\mathbb{P}(\operatorname{Sym}^3 V^{\vee})\to B$. The section $\sigma$ maps each point $b$ to the equation of the cubic surface $X_b$ lying above it.

Inside of $\mathbb{P}(\operatorname{Sym}^3 V^{\vee})$, the section $\sigma$ is induced by the inclusion of a line bundle $L=\det(V^{\vee})\hookrightarrow \operatorname{Sym}^3 V^{\vee}$. {\color{red} Check this, the main thing we need is that the line bundle can be expressed in terms of $c_1(V)$ only. I don't have a clean proof yet.}

Now, we apply \autoref{lem:Q_Zclass}, where $Z\subset \operatorname{Sym}^3(\mathbb{C}^{4\ast})$ is the $GL_4$ orbit closure of a general degree 3 homogenous equation in 4 variables. The vector bundle $V\to B$ induces a map $B\to [\operatorname{pt}/GL_4]$ under which $[\operatorname{Sym}^3(\mathbb{C}^{4\ast})/GL_4]$ pulls back to $\mathbb{P}(\operatorname{Sym}^3 V^{\vee})$. Under the pullback the equivariant class of the projectivized orbit closure $[\mathbb{P}Z]$ pulls back to the class of the relative orbit closure $\mathcal{Z}\subset \mathbb{P}(\operatorname{Sym}^3 V^{\vee})$, where each fiber of $\mathcal{Z}\to B$ is given by $Z$. By \autoref{lem:Q_Zclass}, the class of $\mathcal{Z}$ depends only on the chern classes of $V$. 

The polynomial $P$ in \eqref{eq:P} is the intersection number of $\sigma$ with the class of $\mathcal{Z}$. The class of $\sigma$, the Chow ring of $\mathbb{P}(\operatorname{Sym}^3 V^{\vee})$, and the class of $\mathcal{Z}$ are depend only on the chern classes of $V$. Thus, the final intersection number depends only on the chern classes of $V$ as desired. 
{\color{red} I don't think it'll be any harder to actually determine the formula of $P$ in \eqref{eq:P} in terms of the equivariant class of an orbit closure of a cubic surface, but we don't seem to need the formula. The point is that $P$ and the equivariant class of the orbit closure are equivalent by some substitution.}
\end{proof}

\section{Congruence relations from hypersurfaces with finite automorphisms}
As another another check for the class, I think we can get congruence relations from isotrivial families of hypersurfaces with finite linear automorphisms. This is the same idea as the $3A_2$ family, except the condition holds in $H_{G}(\operatorname{pt})$ with $G$ a finite group instead of $\mathbb{G}_m$. 

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:isotrivial2}
Let $X\subset \mathbb{P}^r$ be a hypersurface with a linear automorphism group $G\subset \operatorname{Aut}(X)\subset GL_{r+1}$. Let $Q$ be the polynomial $Q_Z$ in \autoref{lem:Q_Zclass} where $Z$ \emph{any} equivariant cycle in the space of hypersurfaces not containing $X$. Then, under the linear representation $G\hookrightarrow GL_{r+1}$, $Q$ is sent to zero under the characteristic class map:
\begin{align*}
    A^{\bullet}_{GL_{r+1}}\cong \mathbb{Z}[t_0,\ldots,t_{r}]\to A^{\bullet}_{G}(\operatorname{pt}). 
\end{align*}
\end{proposition}

% \begin{proof}
% Continue: the key point is that the twisted family of hypersurfaces comes from descending a trivial section of Sym^d of the universal vector bundle pulled back from BG\to BGL_{r+1}, so intersecting this section with the orbit closure picks out constant term of the projective equivariant class. This constant term is exactly $Q$ in the proposition.

% This is just the general construction of the twisted family:
% Given a hypersurface $X\subset \mathbb{P}^r$ with a finite linear automorphism group $G=\operatorname{Aut}(X)\subset GL_{r+1}$, we want to construct a twisted version of $X$ over $BG$. To this end, take $X\times ((\mathbb{C}^{r+1})^N\backslash Z)\subset \mathbb{P}^r \times ((\mathbb{C}^{r+1})^N\backslash Z)$, where $N>>0$ and $Z$ is some closed set of high codimension. Here $G$ acts on $X$ and $\mathbb{P}^{r+1}$ by linear automorphisms and on each factor of $\mathbb{C}^{r+1}$ via $GL_{r+1}$. The closed set $Z$ is chosen to $G$ acts freely on $(\mathbb{C}^{r+1})^N\backslash Z$. 

% Taking the quotient by $G$ yields a nontrivial family of hypersurfaces $\mathcal{X}\to ((\mathbb{C}^{r+1})^N\backslash Z)/G$ inside the projectivization of some vector bundle $W$ over $((\mathbb{C}^{r+1})^N\backslash Z)/G$.
% \end{proof}
\begin{example}
\autoref{prop:isotrivial2} specializes to \autoref{sec:isotrivial3A2} when applied to the cubic surface $X^3=YZW$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
Every coefficient of every class of a quartic plane curve we computed in \cite{LPT19} is divisible by 4 (even after dividing by the automorphism groups). I think this is a consequence of the Fermat quartic having automorphism group containing $(\mu_4)^3\hookrightarrow GL_3$. Similarly, every equivariant class of a cubic curve orbit is divisible by 3 in \cite[Appendix C]{LPT19}, and this should follow from the Fermat cubic. We will try to prove this in \autoref{prop:divd} below.
\end{example}

Given the example, we will try to flesh out the application of \autoref{prop:3A2} to the Fermat hypersurface applied to the case $G=(\mu_d)^{r+1}\subset GL_{r+1}$. In general, I don't know how to compute the map $A^{\bullet}_{GL_{r+1}}\to A^{\bullet}_{G}(\operatorname{pt})$ (google ``characteristic class of a linear representation''). 

\subsection{Fermat hypersurfaces}
A Fermat hypersurface $X\subset \mathbb{P}^r$ of degree $d$ has a linear automorphism group containing $(\mu_d)^{r+1}$. {\color{red} You can also permute the coordinates, curious what condition in $A^{\bullet}_{S_{r+1}}$ that gives...}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:mu_d}
Under the inclusion $\mu_d\hookrightarrow \mathbb{G}_m$, the map in group cohomology is given by 
\begin{align*}
    \mathbb{Z}[t]=A^{\bullet}_{\mathbb{G}_m}(\operatorname{pt})\to A^{\bullet}_{\mu_d}(\operatorname{pt})=\mathbb{Z}[t]/(dt)
\end{align*}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The ring structure of $A^{\bullet}_{\mu_d}(\operatorname{pt})$ is given by the cohomology ring of the Lens space 
\href{https://mathoverflow.net/questions/133974/reference-for-ring-structure-on-group-cohomology}{(mathoverflow link)}. To compute the map, we take an approximation of $B\mathbb{G}_m$ and $B\mu_d$ to compute the map in $A^{1}_{\mathbb{G}_m}(\operatorname{pt})\to A^{1}_{\mu_d}(\operatorname{pt})$. This reduces to a familiar geometric example of a cone over a rational normal curve.

We approximate using the map $B\mu_d\to B\mathbb{G}_m$ using
\begin{align*}
    \pi: S=\operatorname{Spec}(\mathbb{C}[x^d, x^{d-1}y,\ldots,y^d])=(\mathbb{A}^2\backslash\{0\})/\mu_d\to (\mathbb{A}^2\backslash\{0\})/\mathbb{G}_m=\mathbb{P}^1. 
\end{align*}
The map $\pi$ is the projection of the cone over a degree $d$ rational normal curve (minus the origin) onto the rational normal curve. The content of \autoref{lem:mu_d} is that a ruling of the cone $S$ over a rational normal curve generates the class group of the cone. 

This is true because $S\backslash L\cong \mathbb{A}^2$ where $L$ is a ruling. (The more nontrivial fact is that $A^{1}(S)\cong \mathbb{Z}/d\mathbb{Z}$, so $[L]$ is exactly $d$-torsion. This is implied by the cohomology of the lens space above, but one can probably prove it directly. For example, $[L]$ is nontrivial in the class group because it cannot be cut out by a single equation (since the tangent space at the cone is at least 3-dimensional for $d>1$).) 
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:divd}
If $Q$ is the polynomial associated to the equivariant class of \emph{any} equivariant class in the space of degree $d$ hypersurfaces not containing the Fermat hypersurface, then every coefficient of $Q$ is divisible by $d$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
This follows from \autoref{lem:mu_d} and \autoref{prop:isotrivial2}.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
For a general cubic surface, our current guess is that:
$$Q = 25920 c_1^4+12960 c_1^2 c_2-6480 c_1 c_3+9720 c_4$$
 and
$$P = 1080 c_1^2 c_2-1080 c_1 c_3+9720 c_4,$$
where the $P$ and $Q$ are related by
\begin{align*}
P(t_0,t_1,t_2,t_3) &= Q(t_0 - \frac{t_0+\cdots+t_3}{3},\ldots, t_3 - \frac{t_0+\cdots+t_3}{3})\\
P(t_0 - (t_0+\cdots+t_3), \ldots, t_3 - (t_0+\cdots+t_3)) &= Q(t_0,\ldots,t_3)
\end{align*}
The coefficients of $Q$  are all divisible by 3 as predicted.
